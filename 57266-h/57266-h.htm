<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="dropcap">So much has been written about Cambridge
that it is difficult to say anything new;
and this little book is therefore merely an attempt
to put together recorded facts in an orderly way.
I have followed throughout the arrangement
adopted by Mr Wells in his book on “Oxford
and its Colleges,” and have also borrowed his
method of marking the portraits of college
worthies with an asterisk. Every writer on
Cambridge must be under a great obligation
to Willis and Clark’s Architectural History
of the University; and Mr Atkinson’s lately
published book gives a singular completeness to
the authorities for the architectural side of the
question. Building at Cambridge, however, is
a complex problem,—the history of Clare and
the University Church are cases in point—and
to follow out carefully every date and mark
every alteration would be beyond these limits.
My endeavour has been, therefore, to indicate
the general date of every building rather than
to assign a date to every particular part of its
construction. For the historical part of the
book, the authorities, grave and anecdotal, are
too numerous to mention. Among modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
works on the subject, I owe a great deal to
Mr J. W. Clark’s “Cambridge: Historical
and Picturesque Notes” (Seeley, 1890). I
am sure, too, that whatever interest my own
part in this book may lack, Mr New’s drawings
will more than supply.</p>

<span class="smaller">CAMBRIDGE</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Dr Caius’ ingenious contention that Cambridge
was founded in 3538 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> by
Cantaber, a Spanish prince, has never received
the support which its audacity deserves. The
town cannot pretend to so great an antiquity,
nor is its Roman origin even certain. It stood
in the middle of a country intersected by Roman
lines of road; in no part of England are Roman
and British remains more plentiful and more
interesting. The Via Devana, the great highroad
from Colchester to Chester, was the road
which runs through the modern town from the
station to Magdalene Bridge, and continues in
a straight line to Godmanchester and Huntingdon.
The Via Iceniana, or Icknield Way,
which ran straight across England from the
Eastern Counties, parts company with the Cambridge
road on Newmarket Heath, and pursues
an undulating course south-westward to Royston
and Hitchin. Ermine Street, the Old North
Road, ran through Caxton, ten miles west of
Cambridge, and met the Via Devana at Huntingdon.
At Gogmagog Hills, five miles out of
the town, we can trace the remains of Vandlebury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Camp, which commanded the course of the
Roman roads, and looked over the southern
Fens and the Essex border. The familiar
name of Grantchester is certainly of Roman
origin. Instances might be multiplied to show
how important this country was to Roman
strategy. But there is no direct evidence to
prove that Cambridge of to-day represents the
ancient Camboritum. The Castle Hill, that
odd mound from which so good a view of the
town is obtained, is supposed to be in its origin
Saxon; it formed an important outpost against
the Danes, who have left so many traces of
their occupation in Norfolk and Suffolk. And
the municipal history of Cambridge certainly
begins with Saxon times, and it was the seat
of one of the earliest Gilds. Mr Atkinson, who
has so admirably traced the municipal constitution
of the town, gives us some details of the purpose
and form of the Cambridge Gild of Thanes. It
was what we should call to-day a friendly society;
its members afforded each other mutual help.
Such Gilds became common in Cambridge as in
every town during the Middle Ages; they were
the great aids to municipal life, and we shall find
that some of them grew rich and powerful enough
to found a College on their own account.</p>

<p>Our business is, however, with the University.
One cannot fix a deliberate date of foundation.
Universities, like every other great design, have
small beginnings, and the origin of schools at
Cambridge was probably insignificant. Cambridge
is on the border of the Fenland, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Fenland contained the richest abbeys in England.
Besides the great house of Ely, where the bishop
was by virtue of his office abbot, there were,
within easy reach of Cambridge, the four Benedictine
abbeys of Peterborough, Ramsey, Thorney
and Crowland, all of them in the very first rank of
English houses. Life in the Fens was hard and
dismal, and even Peterborough, the Medehampstead
or Goldenburgh of Saxon times, must
have been largely under water for a great part
of the year. The towns on the borders, Cambridge
or Stamford, formed an excellent asylum
for those brethren who were too weak to endure
the unhealthy mists of the Nene and Welland
Wash. During the middle ages, Cambridge
bristled with small religious houses, cells depending
on the greater abbeys; and in these the
young monks of Crowland and the other houses
received their education. This was the beginning
of the University. The academic life was
the life of the cloister. The teaching consisted
of the ordinary medieval sciences, Aristotle and
the scholastic logic. In after years, Erasmus
deprecated the attachment of Cambridge pedants
to Aristotle and their unreadiness to accept the
new learning. Cambridge never was quite so
famous a nursery of schoolmen as Oxford; her
history is somewhat more peaceful. Nor, when
the medieval theology fell into discredit, did she
produce a teacher with the European fame of
Wyclif. Her history, however, has a chronology
almost parallel with that of Oxford. Out
of the monastic system was evolved the freer life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of colleges. Oxford led the way with University
and Merton; Cambridge followed with
Peterhouse. The college, as distinct from the
monastery, was a place of retreat whose aim was
learning; the aim of the monastery was self-discipline.
It is needless to say that these colleges
were established upon a clerical basis: each was
a society consisting of a master and a certain
number of fellows. Their constitution was that
of a public School; the modern undergraduate
system was a much later development. The
early founders had no idea of a college in the
modern sense; a society principally composed of
laymen, and a large body of undergraduates who
to all intents and purposes are the College. The
one link which connects our colleges of to-day
with the original foundations is the existence of
a college chapel, uniting the various members of
the institution for the prime object of the learned
society, the glory of God.</p>

<p>Medieval Cambridge lay, as our Cambridge
still lies, east of the river, which flowed in a
course more or less corresponding to its present
direction. It was enclosed by the King’s Ditch,
a stream at a tangent to the main river. This
started from the Mill Pool at the bottom of
Silver Street, and was crossed by Trumpington
Street at the Trumpington Gate, close to Pembroke.
In fact, it followed the present Mill
Lane and Downing Street pretty closely, keeping
to the left, until it reached Barnwell Gate at
the bottom of Petty Cury. From Barnwell
Gate it followed the present Hobson Street, ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
across Sidney Gardens and down Park Street,
skirted Midsummer Common and rejoined the
Cam about a hundred and fifty yards below
Magdalene Bridge. Within this elliptic space
the old town was contained. If you stood at the
Round Church, you would see the two familiar
main thoroughfares separate as they do to-day.
That to the left, Bridge Street and Sidney Street,
was called Conduit Street: it led to the King’s
Ditch at Barnwell Gate. That to the right,
St John’s Street and Trinity Street, led to the
principal medieval foundations. On the right
hand of it was the Hospital of St John; on the
left the Jewry and All Saints’ Church, with its
tower projecting over the roadway, like St John
Maddermarket’s at Norwich. Just beyond on
the right was King’s Hall, with King’s Hall
Lane leading to the river. The next turning, St
Michael’s Lane, the present Trinity Lane, led in
the same direction to Garret Hostel Bridge. In
St Michael’s Lane was Michael House, and St
Michael’s and King’s Hall Lanes were connected
by the narrow and dirty street called
Foul Lane. These two colleges and the
tortuous lanes connecting them occupied the site
of Trinity. The main street, after passing St
Michael’s Church, came to Great St Mary’s
Church, and proceeded along King’s Parade as
High Street. On either side of this thoroughfare
was an indiscriminate mass of houses—the
great court of King’s did not exist. Its site was
then a labyrinth of narrow alleys and beetling tenements.
A winding lane led across the space now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
occupied by the lawn east of King’s Chapel, to the
Schools, and skirting them, ran into the street
leading from Michael House to the Mill Pool,
called Milne Street. Of this street, which
passed Clare and crossed King’s where Gibbs’
building stands, we still preserve the original
course in Queen’s Lane. It was connected with
the parallel High Street by Piron Lane, which
occupied the north side of the court at King’s,
and St Austin’s Lane, which was the modern
King’s Lane. Several lanes led from Milne
Street down to the river. Milne Street was
terminated by Small Bridges Street, now Silver
Street, which crossed the river from Newnham
and joined High Street at St Botolph’s Church.</p>

<p>On the other side of High Street the confusion
was even worse. Many people can remember
the days when the broad thoroughfares
on either side of Great St Mary’s were filled
with tumble-down houses. This picturesque
and unsanitary state of things was almost the last
remnant of medieval Cambridge. In this rabbit-warren
lived many of the tradespeople. The
names of the lanes between High Street and the
Market Place are sufficient testimony. The
Sheerer’s Row, north of Great St Mary’s, was
continued by the Shoemaker’s Row, which is now
Market Street. The Market Place was so
largely blocked up by this dense mass of houses
that it occupied not more than half of its present
site. In its centre was the Conduit; west of
the Conduit was the Cross. The Tolbooth and
Prison were on the south of the space, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Guildhall is. In front of the Tolbooth were the
shambles, and, east of this savoury neighbourhood
Petty Cury, the Little Cookery, led to Barnwell
Gate. From the Market Place, Peas Hill led,
as now, to Bene’t Street, and Bene’t Street led
back to High Street, just where King’s Parade
joins Trumpington Street. Free School Lane,
at the back of Saint Bene’t’s Church and Corpus,
was called Luthburgh Lane, and the original
buildings of Corpus opened into this and not into
Trumpington Street, as at present. Just before
reaching Pembroke, High Street was brought to
a stop by Trumpington Gate, just as Conduit
Street was finished by Barnwell Gate. On the
other side of the King’s Ditch were the Church
of St Peter and the foundation of Peterhouse.</p>

<p>Another point which the visitor to medieval
Cambridge would notice would be the abundance
of religious houses. Great towns, such as London
or Bristol, were well off in this way, but Cambridge
could not compare in size with these
cities. There are few of these houses whose
remains we cannot trace in one or other of the
colleges. It became, in the fifteenth century,
the fashion to appropriate the monasteries to
purposes of learning. All the great colleges
absorbed some of these institutions. The chief
were outside the King’s Ditch. If accounts are
true, the monastery of the Augustinian Canons
at Barnwell must have formed a splendid object
in any prospect of Cambridge. To reach it, one
would pass through meadows, with the nunnery
of St Mary and St Rhadegund away to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
left. In the southern part of Barnwell, beyond
Barnwell Gate, was the house of Black Friars,
on one side of Preachers’ Street, the <i lang="fr">faubourg</i>
which stretched outside the town boundaries and
formed the southern approach to Cambridge.
This friary is now Emmanuel College. Outside
Trumpington Gate was a house of Gilbertine
Canons; and opposite it was the house of Friars
of the Sack, which became incorporated with
Peterhouse. In Cambridge itself the Friars were
well represented. The Grey Friars occupied
the site of Sidney Sussex College; the White
Friars, that picturesque order which reckoned
Elijah as its patriarch, had a house on part of
the site of Queens’ College. The Austin Friars
lived on a piece of ground very nearly corresponding
to the University laboratories, which
was entered from Bene’t Street, just where that
street meets Peas Hill. All these friaries were
bounded on one side by water: the Carmelite
house met the river; the Franciscan and
Augustinian houses abutted on the ditch. Of
these monastic buildings in the town we have
scarcely any trace; their position is merely
distinguishable. The Dominican house was
swept away by the founders of Emmanuel, and
no one could detect any monastic remains in the
prosaic aspect of that eminently Puritan college.
At Jesus, however, Alcock successfully preserved
the plan of the nunnery; and the college which
we see is in substance a monastic building.
Barnwell Priory, with the exception of a small
chantry-chapel, has disappeared. The Augustinian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hospital of St John has been blotted out
by St John’s College; its beautiful piscina,
incorporated in Sir Gilbert Scott’s chapel, is
its only relic. And, actually, the only building
which has been allowed to stand without alteration
is the remote and melancholy Lepers’ Chapel
at Stourbridge, a beautiful Norman building,
which was attached to the Hospital of St Mary
Magdalene.</p>

<p>Stourbridge is a good mile beyond Jesus
College. In the field close by the Leper’s
Chapel was held the famous Stourbridge Fair,
the English counterpart of Beaucaire and Nijni-Novgorod.
There is no doubt that the medieval
Cambridge owed its fame in a very large measure
to this annual mart. It was the most important
of a series of fairs in the Eastern Counties—Tombland
Fair at Norwich and the marts of
Lynn and Wisbech have still a certain celebrity—and
its interest is largely enhanced by the fact
that, after the dissolution of the leper’s hospital,
its original proprietor under a charter of King
John, the University had an official connection
with it. It lasted for a month, from August
24th to September 28th, and during that period
received visits from all the principal merchants
in England. It was opened by the Vice-Chancellor
in person and was patronised, perhaps
rather noisily, by the University generally. Its
commercial importance is to be gathered from a
passage in Defoe’s <cite>Tour of Great Britain</cite>, quoted
by Mr Atkinson in his interesting account of the
fair. Hops and wool were the two great staples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of trade, and Stourbridge Fair determined the
price of hops in England. It was thus not a
mere place of pleasure, but resembled the great
nomadic markets of the east. Anybody who has
been to Lynn Mart or to Stourbridge Fair itself
in its sorry old age knows that to-day the great
business of the fairs consists in steam roundabouts
and side-shows. The roundabout is a late development,
but the side-show has an honourable
antiquity. Stourbridge Fair boasted, within the
last century, a theatre where legitimate Shaksperian
drama was admirably performed by a
Norwich company. The performances were
largely attended by the University, and enterprising
ladies like Mrs Frere of Downing were
to be seen there with fashionable parties. The
story is often told of “rare Richard Farmer,”
Master of Emmanuel, how he and a few friends,
ardent lovers of Shakspere, attended the Stourbridge
Theatre night after night, occupying a
bench especially reserved for them.</p>

<p>At Stourbridge Fair University and Town
took joint management of the proceedings.
They did not, however, love one another very
cordially, and the Town resented the rights which
the University enforced with some arrogance.
“Town and Gown rows” were, in the ordinary
course of things, not very common. When they
broke out, they were serious; but usually the
University was much to blame. For example,
in James I.’s time, George Ruggle, fellow of
Clare, wrote a play in derision of the town’s
folk, to which the college, with the worst taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
invited the Mayor and Corporation. But that
the town, at any rate in medieval times, watched
the growth of the University with favour, is
sufficiently proved by the refoundation of Corpus
Christi College, the work of townspeople. The
University repaid the debt in subsequent years
by foundations like Perse’s Grammar School and
Addenbrooke’s Hospital. We must remember
that, ecclesiastically, the connection of town and
university was for some centuries very close.
The church of St Mary by the Market was not
merely the chapel of King’s Hall; it was also a
parish church, and a large and important gild
of merchants had their chapel within its walls.
At first, the colleges were entirely opposed to
the monastic spirit. They did not worship in
their own chapels, but joined in the devotions of
the ordinary congregations, going to church just
as the grammar school of any town in England
attends the parish church, as a matter of course.
The extreme youth of the scholars completes
the comparison. But, as the colleges grew in
riches and numbers, they reverted to the monastic
ideal, and each built its own chapel. The Town
and University drew apart from each other, and
the University became the more important body.
Moreover, while the learning of the University
grew, the trade of the town diminished. The
gradual diversion of trade from the Eastern
Counties, the decay of ports like Lynn, with
whose commerce Cambridge was inseparably
linked, all the changes in the physical geography
of the Fens, reduced the importance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
town. It would be unfair to assert that Cambridge,
as a whole, exists for the sake of the
University; but there is no doubt that the
nucleus of the town, its whole western quarter,
is devoted to that purpose, and that, without the
University, it would be of little more importance
than Huntingdon or St Ives—of less importance,
probably, than Ely or Wisbech, which are still
at the head of an excellent water-way.</p>

<p>Cambridge, no less than Oxford, took her
part in the religious commotions of the sixteenth
century. She was deeply concerned in the revival
of learning. She shares with Oxford the
honour of enrolling Waynflete and Foxe among
the members of the University. Bishop Fisher
belongs entirely to her, and, in consequence,
Cambridge was the University which the Lady
Margaret favoured more conspicuously. Erasmus
taught in her schools. Even before the Dissolution,
she showed, by her appropriation of
religious houses to scholastic purposes, the growth
of that liberal spirit which is thought to be her
intellectual distinction. We shall see how pious
Churchmen like Bishop Alcock and a medieval
devotee like Lady Margaret did not scruple to
sweep away monasteries for the sake of learning.
Even monasteries themselves, in these later days,
followed up their own initiative and endowed
colleges. Several abbeys united to found Buckingham
College. Alcock, by virtue of his
episcopal office, was abbot of the great monastery
of Ely. In the great struggle which followed
the revival of learning as its natural outcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Cambridge contributed her martyrs to both
sides. Fisher died in the defence of a rigid
principle. On the other hand, Cambridge prepared
those three reformers who suffered for
their opinions at Oxford. Cranmer was a fellow
of Jesus, Ridley was Master of Pembroke,
Latimer belonged to the societies of Christ’s and
Clare. It is not at all surprising that their influence,
combined with the constant importation
of Genevan teachers, rendered Cambridge very
susceptible for a time to reformed doctrine of a
foreign type. But the final result of the Reformation
in the University is shown by the intellectual
freedom of her greatest sons. Bacon and
Sir Isaac Newton are the obvious examples of
this, but their illustrious personalities should not
allow us to forget the brilliant ingenuity of the
Cambridge Platonists; while, side by side with
the greatest of all we may place the name of
John Milton.</p>

<p>Milton, whose life is very largely bound up
with Cambridge, brings us to another critical
point in University history. It is difficult to
estimate the attitude of Cambridge as a whole to
the Civil Wars. Oxford remained faithful to the
King, but, while Cambridge possessed no college
so unanimously loyal as St John’s at Oxford,
there were one or two colleges, such as Sidney
and Emmanuel, whose sympathies were undeniably
Puritan. An University cannot help a certain
amount of conservatism, and Cambridge sacrificed
a great deal in the Stewart cause. A few years
ago, at the exhibition of plate in the Fitzwilliam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Museum, one realised the substantial cost of that
sacrifice. But the Fens and the whole neighbourhood
were devoted to the interest of the
Parliament, and there were actually few who
surrendered themselves as martyrs to the royalist
cause. On the religious side of the question,
however, Cambridge has a good deal to show.
Some of the most eminent Caroline divines are
hers. Lancelot Andrewes, John Cosin, Jeremy
Taylor, Peter Gunning, to mention no other names,
were all Cambridge men. George Herbert and
Nicholas Ferrar were men of some academical
distinction. But, if it is true that architecture is
the best witness to history, no town in England
shows more trace of the Puritan spirit than
Cambridge. While the Oxford buildings of
the seventeenth century are gravely Gothic and
semi-ecclesiastical, the only building of this
type in Cambridge is the picturesque chapel at
Peterhouse. The library of St John’s, beautiful
though it is, is a hybrid example of the order.
Other seventeenth century work, the work of
Ralph Symons, for example, the court of Clare,
and Wren’s masterpieces at Trinity and Emmanuel,
are frankly domestic. Men such as I
have mentioned above, belong to a <i lang="fr">coterie</i>, but do
not represent the general temper of their age.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the state of the
University was more or less torpid. It was the
age of combination rooms and good port, of hard-and-fast
social distinctions and formal gatherings.
The Universities, during this period, lost
their touch with English life, and were not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the forcing-houses of wit. This is especially
true of Cambridge. The first half of the century
is absorbed in the great quarrel between Bentley
and his society. Bentley is unquestionably the
most commanding figure of his time at Cambridge;
for Newton by this time belonged chiefly
to London. But Bentley was hated by the
great company of wits, who had, for the most
part, little to do with either University. Pope,
Swift, Fielding and Richardson, the four
writers who had the greatest influence on their
century, were connected with neither Oxford nor
Cambridge. And, from 1750 to 1790, there is
very little to relieve the general dulness which
settled over Cambridge. Mr John Willis
Clark, in a delightful and only too short
chapter, has revived for us the social etiquette
and pleasures of the period. But the pleasures
themselves are remarkable, for the most part,
for their unconscious humour. And even the
epigrams, in spite of their uniform cleverness, are
a trifle heavy.</p>

<p>The French Revolution woke Cambridge from
this long sleep. It was an active stimulant to
the imagination. The fall of the Bastille had
its effect upon Wordsworth at St John’s and
Coleridge at Jesus; its immediate result, the
general cry for independence, moved Byron
at Trinity. The romantic enthusiasm set in,
and with it that love for a liberal education apart
from mechanical scholarship which is so prominent
a factor in both Oxford and Cambridge to-day.
In short, the modern life of the University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
began; Cambridge began once more to play its
part in English intellectual life. Wordsworth and
Tennyson, of all poets, have done most to stimulate
the minds of their countrymen, and both
owe no small portion of their personal influence
to Cambridge. And, side by side with this
intellectual revival, one cannot fail to notice
the spiritual revival inaugurated by the Wesleys
at Oxford, and naturalised by Charles Simeon
at Cambridge. This simply means the awakening
of the University to the other side of her
responsibilities. In the Oxford movement, which
was the logical result of this revival, Cambridge
had very little share. Her traditions were somewhat
different from those of Oxford, and her
theological tendencies took what is usually known
as a “broader” direction. Her position is indicated
by the names of F. D. Maurice and Charles
Kingsley. At the same time, her school of
theology, under Ellicott, Lightfoot, Hort and
Westcott, has preserved its scientific basis and
cannot be surpassed in any University. And
time would fail to tell of what triumphs she
has won in other fields. Darwin in biology,
Thomson in electricity, Adams in astronomy,
are names which tell their own tale. With these
main activities, too, others have grown. The
energies of the University have been expanded
in every direction. The multiplication of open
scholarships and prizes, the University Extension
system, the foundation of colleges for women,
are only a few of the ways in which her influence
has been doubled throughout Great Britain. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in all this surely her founders and benefactors
have full recompense for their labours—in the
love which the University excites in her sons
and in the contribution of each member to the
corporate action of the whole body.</p>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">The Church of St Mary-by-the-Market, better
known as Great St Mary’s, is, as it stands
at present, a fine example of the latest style of
English architecture. Two churches, when it
was built, had already occupied the site. The
first, entirely parochial, was probably built in
Norman times, but was burned down in 1290.
By that time, however, the University then
emerging from its embryonic state into actual
life, had begun to use it for its meetings. The
church formed, as it were, the earliest Senate
House. After the fire, which, like so many
medieval catastrophes, was put down to the
Jews, the structure was renewed in the style of
the period. We find that Thomas de L’Isle,
Bishop of Ely, granted a license for the consecration
of the High Altar in 1346; and that,
in 1351, the consecration took place under his
successor, Simon of Langham. The chancel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
still retains some features of this remodelled
church. In the year after the consecration,
the Gild of the Blessed Virgin Mary, parishioners
of this church, joined with the Gild of Corpus
Christi in the foundation of Corpus College;
and, in 1342, Edward III. had granted the
advowson of St Mary’s to the scholars of King’s
Hall. In this way it happened that, at the
subsequent rebuilding of the church, the town,
the University, and the college were equally
concerned in it. The present building was begun
in 1478, when John Morton was Bishop of Ely,
and the main structure, roughly speaking, belongs
to the period between that year and 1491. It
is supposed that, during this reconstruction, the
services were held in the chancel, which, presumably,
was merely remodelled in the perpendicular
manner. The character of the nave is,
for its period, strikingly excellent, and the work
is not unlike that at St Nicholas, Lynn, and other
fine churches in the eastern counties. The surface-ornament
in the spandrils of the chancel-arch and
nave arcade is exceptionally good, and the depression
of the arches is very slight. Characteristically,
the piers have no capitals, but a small shaft with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a plain capital carries the innermost moulding.
But the best feature of the interior is the high,
plain clerestory, from which the church originally
received its principal light. This forms, as it
were, a wall of glass running along the upper
storey of the church. Its lowest part is panelled,
forming a kind of mock triforium. On the
whole, there are few more stately churches of
the date in England.</p>

<p>Although this nave was completed in 1491,
it was not ready for service till 1519, when the
nave was seated and the Great Rood suspended
from the chancel-arch. Meanwhile, the tower
had been begun in 1491, and progressed very
slowly. In 1515 it was at a standstill and had
a thatched roof. The west window, however,
which, considering that it belongs to Henry
VIII.’s reign, is surprisingly good Gothic, was
glazed by 1536. After this time a certain
amount of work went on, and the tower was
carried up to the string-course. In 1576, Sir
Walter Mildmay gave twenty tons of freestone
towards the building, which was employed in
erecting a somewhat heavy Italianised porch
at the west end. This, with its great pediment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and the clock above it, filled up the space
between the buttresses and reached up to the sill
of the west window. Sir Walter Mildmay
promised other materials for the completion of
the tower by a stone spire. This never took
place, and, in 1593, the parish decided to add
a final storey on their own account, which was
completed in 1596. This storey, with its
octagonal corner-turrets and debased windows,
is nevertheless in no violent contrast to the work
below. In 1608, the turrets were completed
and stone balls were placed upon the pinnacles
by Robert Grumbold, to whom we owe the
balls on Clare Bridge.</p>

<p>The last internal addition to the church was
the magnificent rood-loft, finished in 1523. It
extended not only across the chancel-arch, but
across the northern arch, leading to the Chapel
of St Andrew, and the southern, leading to the
Chapel of Our Lady. These chapels were
further separated from the chancel by parclose-screens.
The contract states that the rood-lofts
at Thriplow, south of Cambridge, and at Gazeley,
between Newmarket and Bury St Edmunds,
were the models used for this structure. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
have been something like the great rood-lofts
which still exist in Devonshire and parts of
Norfolk. In the middle, below the rood-beam
and facing the choir, was the University pulpit.
But this screen, with its elaborate furniture, its
“yomages,” candles and gilding did not have a
long existence. It was destroyed by Archbishop
Parker, that sworn enemy of rood-lofts, in 1562.
However, during the Laudian revival, in 1640,
another chancel-screen was erected, part of which
remains across the chapel of St Andrew. Its
fine composition and carving are characteristic of
the Stewart era. Another and even better screen
of a somewhat earlier date is to be seen in the
church of Tilney All Saints, near Lynn. However,
this screen perished in its turn, not at the
hands of the zealot Dowsing, who destroyed as
much as he could, but under the gentle influence
of Georgian restorers. It appears that, after the
Reformation, the University sermon became
more of an institution than it had been, and was
no longer preached to the chancel. Great St
Mary’s was, however, put to other and more
secular uses. Laud was informed that the body
of the church was seated like a theatre; that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pulpit was placed in the middle and called the
Cock-pit; that at sermon-time the chancel was
filled with boys and townsmen “and other whiles
(thereafter as the Preacher is) with <em>Townswomen</em>
also, all in a rude heap between the Doctors and
the Altar”; that the “Service there (which is
done by Trin. Coll.) is commonly posted over
and cut short at the pleasure of him that is sent
thither to read it.” Divers other informations
were laid against the state of the church. It
certainly seems curious to our own day that the
Commencements should have been held in
church, and that the feeble buffoonery of the
“Prevaricator” should have been, under these
circumstances, their leading feature. The feeling
against these extraordinary ceremonies led to the
building of the Senate House, which was large
enough for disputations as well as meetings of the
senate. But Sir James Burrough, to whom the
Senate House is partly due, did his best to spoil
the University Church. The screen of 1640,
which, with its spirelets and canopies, must have
been very like the Laudian screens remaining in
one or two northern churches,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was taken down;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and the church was devoted entirely to the
cult of the sermon. Mr William Worts had
previously left a legacy to the University, which
was employed in erecting the present galleries
(1735). The Cock-pit was remodelled, and
the centre of the church was filled with an
immense octagonal pulpit on the “three-decker”
principle, the crowning glory and apex of which
was approached, like a church-tower, by an
internal staircase. About 1740, Burrough filled
the chancel-arch and chancel with a permanent
gallery, which commanded a thorough view
of this object. The gallery, known as the
“Throne” was an extraordinary and unique
erection. The royal family of Versailles never
worshipped more comfortably than did the Vice-Chancellor
and heads of houses, in their beautiful
arm-chairs, and the doctors, sitting on the tiers
of seats behind them. In this worship of the
pulpit, the altar was quite disregarded, and Cole
the antiquary remarked sorrowfully on this discreditable
fact. Undergraduates, whose power
of expression was not equal to their sense of
humour, irreverently called the Throne Golgotha,
because the heads of houses sat there. The church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
thus became an oblong box, with the organ at
one end, the Throne at the other, and the pulpit
between them. The portentous array of bevelled
and panelled oak plunged the church in darkness,
and so, in 1766, the aisle windows were altered
and the present meagre insertions made.</p>

<p>This domestic comfort pervaded the church
until 1863. The Camden Society destroyed
the picturesque top of the tower in 1842, but
did not touch the interior of the church. In
1851 Sir Gilbert Scott took away Mildmay’s
porch, and substituted for it the present west
door. Much about the same time, the ground
round St Mary’s was cleared of houses. Dr
Luard, the late registrary, who was then Vicar,
agitated for the removal of the “throne” for a
long time, and at last the work of reconstruction
began. The present nave-seats and chancel-stalls,
in a somewhat florid style, were put in, and
the only remains of the old preaching-house were
the galleries and the organ at the west end. This
organ, which dates from 1698, and is in part
the work of Father Smith, was rebuilt by Messrs
Hill in 1870. In 1888 the south porch was
rebuilt on the lines of a porch which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
destroyed in 1783. Under the present vicar,
Dr Cunningham, the work of restoration has advanced.
The tower has been thoroughly repaired,
and a new organ has been built for parochial
services on the south side of the choir. Further,
the late Mr Sandars, who did so much for the
University, filled in the lower part of the aisle
windows with the arms of those noblemen and
prelates who subscribed to the nave between
1478 and 1519. These windows, which are by
Messrs Powell, are full of interesting matter
for the student of monastic heraldry. Messrs
Powell are similarly engaged in filling the
clerestory windows with admirable figure-glass.
Altogether, during the last half-century, the
church has returned some way towards its
original design. There is now a side altar in
St Andrew’s Chapel, which is used as the chapel
of the Clergy Training-School; the Lady Chapel
is occupied by the vestry. And, finally, one
must not forget the “Cambridge chimes” in
the tower, which were composed in 1790 by
Dr Jowett of garden fame, and are the model of
all such chimes throughout England.</p>

<span class="smaller">PETERHOUSE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">From the churchyard of Little St Mary’s
Church a good idea of the medieval buildings
of Peterhouse may be obtained. Unfortunately,
James Essex was allowed to do as he liked with
the old court somewhere about 1770, and faced
it in the hideous, commonplace style of the time.
It is astonishing that he allowed the back of the
older building, so out of harmony with the
cherished classical unities of his day, to remain
in so conspicuous a position. But the obvious
history of the buildings begins with Dr Andrew
Perne’s library, whose later extension with its
gabled end and oriel is such a picturesque object
in the perspective of Trumpington Street, and
contrasts so oddly with the Corinthian portico
of the Fitzwilliam Museum, just beyond. Perne’s
work is in that familiar, country-house style
which, rather later, we associate in Cambridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with the name of Ralph Symons. The building
of 1590 forms the eastern extension of the
Hall and Combination Room. It was prolonged
in 1632 to stand flush with the present
street-pavement. Bishop Matthew Wren made
a more notable and more characteristic addition.
He built the chapel, which was consecrated in
1632, on a site in the eastern half of the court,
just midway between the two wings. At the
same time he united his building to the wings
by an open cloister supporting a covered
gallery. The chapel and cloisters, which divide
the court into two unequal halves, have a good
deal of picturesqueness, but they are built in a
very stilted Italian manner, full of shallow late
Gothic detail. The chapel has a considerable
reputation founded on its stained glass windows,
which are by Professor Aimmüller of Munich.
They are astonishing specimens of their art, and
reflect the taste of the middle of the century
very well. An excellent Flemish east window,
contemporary with the building, is usually
considered to harmonise very ill with these
productions, whose qualities, nevertheless, it
considerably enhances.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the Georgian <i lang="fr">régime</i> Peterhouse suffered
a great deal. Sir James Burrough of Caius,
then neither Master nor a Knight, had a grand
plan for taking down Perne’s library and Wren’s
cloisters and putting up buildings of his own.
Happily, the funds for this undertaking allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
him to finish only the imposing northern wing,
next to Little St Mary’s Church. Like most
of his work, this wing, completed in 1742, is
in very good taste, and the influence of Gibbs’
building at King’s is to be traced throughout.
Nearly half a century later came Essex with a
neat taste acquired, perhaps, in the neighbourhood
of St Marylebone, and made a beautiful structure
exceptionally ugly. Last of all, Mr Francis
Gisborne’s trustees, after his death in 1821,
built a new western court in the then fashionable
sort of Gothic with a part of £20,000
bequeathed to the College in his will. This
court calls for little remark.</p>

<p>Too late to stay the hand of the spoiler, the
Gothic revival has nevertheless done much for
Peterhouse. Mr Gilbert G. Scott in 1870
rebuilt the Hall and Combination Room and
incorporated in them the remains of the medieval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Master’s Lodge, which had been long ago superseded
by the comfortable brick house just across
Trumpington Street. Good, unassuming and
appropriate work in themselves, these buildings
are further decorated with some very successful
stained glass by the late Sir Edward Burne-Jones
and Mr William Morris. The bright oriel of
the Hall is especially beautiful, and the small
figures of poets and of the good women of
Chaucer’s dream in the windows of the comfortable
parlour, share, with the chapel glass,
the impartial admiration of the visitor. It is
satisfactory to think that this historical college
has received some compensation for all the
damage inflicted on it.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In 1281 Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely,
founded St Peter’s College. The reign of
Edward I. is the date from which our universities
derive their organisation, and in many other ways
it marks an epoch in English history. Walter de
Merton, Bishop of Rochester, had, seventeen years
before, founded Merton College at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It
was therefore emulation which, to a certain extent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
inspired Hugh de Balsham in his new departure.
He was a native of Cambridgeshire: his native
place is about ten miles distant from Cambridge,
on the confines of Essex; and he had probably
received his education in one of the numerous
religious houses which filled the Cambridge of
that period. As Bishop of Ely, and therefore
as titular abbot of the monastery, he had much to
do with the monastic institutions of the town,
and it was only natural that, with Walter de
Merton’s example before his eyes, he should
wish to make his name famous in the same way.
He lived just long enough to see the college
established and in a fair way to success, with a
master and fourteen scholars in residence. His
successors at Ely continued his favours to the
college, and during the next century we find the
names of Bishops Simon Montague, Thomas
de L’Isle, Simon Langham and John de Fordham
among the benefactors. It is interesting to note
how purely local University education must have
been at first. Although the first two masters
of Peterhouse appear to have been natives of
distant parts of England, the names of most of
the masters during the fourteenth century recall
the neighbouring fenland. Roger of Mildenhall,
Ralph of Holbeach, William of Whittlesea,
Richard of Wisbech, John of Bottisham, all
are natives of Cambridgeshire or the counties
immediately adjoining. Thomas of Barnard’s
Castle, who became master in 1400, takes us
further north, and he is the last of the list who
derives his surname from his native place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The early history of Peterhouse is concerned
chiefly with its buildings. Under the rule of
John Holbrook (1418-1431) and during the
long mastership of Dr Thomas Lane (1431-73)
the college assumed a definite shape. The
old buildings north of it belong to Holbrook’s
mastership. It took in the house of the
Friars of the Sack, which existed on part of
its site, and thus set a precedent which was
followed almost universally—the substitution of
learned foundations for monasteries and convents.
The Peterhouse of that day, substantially the
building of our own time, was scarcely in Cambridge.
St Peter’s Church lay north of it, and
was itself just outside the Trumpington or South
Gate of the town. It had given its name to the
college, and was used as its chapel from the
earliest period. About the beginning of Edward
III.’s reign, the church was pulled down, and
the present beautiful church of St Mary’s the
Less was built on its site, the college still continuing
to use it as their place of worship. We
may assume that the scholars were required to
assist at mass every morning and at the parochial
mass on Sundays, and that they formed, as it
were, the choir, using the chancel stalls. They
entered the church by the passage and staircase
which still exist south of the chancel.</p>

<p>No famous names occur in connection with
the college before the Reformation. The early
sixteenth century produced a good number of
benefactors, and Hugh de Balsham’s original
provisions were considerably amplified. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
1553 Andrew Perne became master. His
fame is largely local, but he is a very significant
figure in an age chiefly remarkable for
the strength of its religious convictions. His
mastership begins at the end of Edward VI.’s
reign, and lasted for thirty-six years. He combined
with it the Deanery of Ely, and showed
great sagacity in the tenure of both offices.
During Mary’s reign, he was Chancellor of
the University, and under his auspices the
burning of Bucer’s and Fagius’ remains took
place. However, although this somewhat unnecessary
act of vengeance might have stamped
his opinions, he seems to have veered at the
accession of Elizabeth with great suppleness, and
to have trimmed his sails to the royal wind up
to the day of his death. The wits of the
University made his accommodating policy their
butt, and, with the heavy wit of the day, coined
the verb <i lang="la">pernare</i>, which signified “to turn one’s
coat.” Perne, although he possibly merits
some contempt, made nevertheless a very good
use of his unscrupulous comfort. I have
already mentioned his additions to the college.
He also originated that water-supply which is
now so ornamental a feature in certain parts of
the town. The broad gutters along which
streams run down Trumpington Street for most
of the year were not constructed till after his
death, but it was he who first suggested that
healthy water might be brought from the neighbouring
Gogmagog Hills.</p>

<p>To the society of Peterhouse, for some years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of Perne’s time, belonged the celebrated John
Whitgift. Whitgift was an example of a
system which has now ceased to a great extent
in Cambridge. He was an undergraduate of
Queens’ to begin with; he then obtained a
fellowship at Peterhouse, and was in succession
Master of Pembroke and Trinity before his
elevation to a bishoprick. His connection with
Peterhouse is very passing, but, while a member
of the college, he held the Lady Margaret
Professorship of Divinity. In 1567, when he
became Master of Pembroke, he vacated it for
the Regius Professorship, which he held until
his translation to the See of Worcester. At
the same time Peterhouse held also another
professor, Dr Thomas Lorkin, who occupied
the Regius Chair of Physic. Professorships
were then commonly held with other offices,
and John Richardson, fellow of Emmanuel,
who was Master of Peterhouse from 1609 to
1615 was also Regius Professor of Divinity.</p>

<p>Richardson became Master of Trinity in
1615. In the time of his successor, Thomas
Turner, one of Peterhouse’s most celebrated
sons was in residence, the poet Richard Crashaw.
The beginning of the sixteenth century found
many poets at Cambridge, of whom Crashaw is
certainly not the least remarkable. Like George
Herbert, who was some twenty years his senior,
he was brought up in the traditions of the Church
of England, but scarcely had time to prove his
principles before the outbreak of the Civil War.
He was by temperament a mystic, and his early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
love-poems show a certain religious tendency.
It is probable that his study of St Theresa and
the bigotry of the Puritan party drove him,
between them, into the Church of Rome. He
eventually took orders and died as a Canon of
Loreto. His mystical poems have become very
fashionable of late years, and he certainly
deserves a very high place among our lyric
poets. He was also a musician. Although
we know little of his life at Cambridge, it is
certain that he must have been a prominent
figure in the intellectual life of a period when
University life was entirely intellectual.</p>

<p>In 1632 the chapel was finished and was
consecrated in the next year by Bishop Francis
White of Ely. Next year the master, Dr
Matthew Wren, was succeeded by Dr John
Cosin. The new master was one of the most
acute theologians of the century, and was deeply
impressed, like most contemporary churchmen,
with the possibilities of the Church of England.
He was one of the first to vindicate its position
and maintain its orders as valid. His proceedings
at Peterhouse were hardly popular. Cambridge
has never been guilty of over-rating
external forms of worship, and, in the case of
Cosin, she showed her indignation very plainly.
The Puritans were furious at his ritual; they
complained of his bowings and genuflexions, and
of the crucifix he set up over the altar of his
chapel. In 1643 the iconoclast Dowsing paid
a visit to Cambridge, and used the most drastic
remedies at Peterhouse. Fortunately, the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
east window, which would have provoked
his zealous wrath, was hidden by the Society
and escaped damage. Cosin was ejected by
Parliament in 1644, and for sixteen years the
college was ruled by Lazarus Seaman. Cosin
returned at the Restoration, and the “idols”
were restored to their proper place. But in the
same year Cosin was rewarded for his long
exile with the See of Durham. In the magnificent
chapel which he built at Auckland Castle,
we may trace in some measure his affection to
Peterhouse; for its beautiful late Gothic was
doubtless suggested by Dr Wren’s chapel.</p>

<p>Cosin has had no very conspicuous successors.
He was the last Master of Peterhouse but
one who became a bishop. His immediate
predecessors, Leonard Maw and Matthew
Wren, were both translated to bishopricks:
Maw to Bath and Wells, and Wren, whose
name is most famous, to Ely. During the
time of Dr Law,* Bishop of Carlisle, who was
master from 1754 to 1788, and filled for a
short time the chair of Moral Philosophy, the
poet Gray was obliged to change his residence to
Pembroke. Gray is one of those persons, uncommon
in the last century, who saw beauty in
nature, and he became a kind of artistic apostle
at Cambridge. This position, which usually connotes
a superiority amounting to superciliousness,
did not render him popular at Peterhouse. He
had a horror of fire, and kept a fire-escape
attached to his window. One night, some of
the more normal members of the college raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
an alarm of fire, and Gray descended his
fire-escape into a bucket of water which had
been prepared for him. Having all that lack
of humour which is distinctive of æsthetic reformers,
he migrated to Pembroke, where he
seems to have been better appreciated than in
his own college. He lived in Pembroke for the
last twenty-five years of his life, and, for the
last three (1768-71), was Regius Professor of
Modern History.</p>

<p>Dr Law died in 1788, and was succeeded by
Dr Francis Barnes,* who continued in his seat
for fifty years, holding, like his predecessor, the
Professorship of Moral Philosophy from 1813 to
his death in 1838. Then Dr Hodgson was
master for nine years, and his successor, Dr
Cookson, was succeeded in 1876 by the present
Master. Among the notable men of the present
day Peterhouse claims the Archbishop of York
and Lord Kelvin.* Through Lord Kelvin’s
generosity, it was the first college in Cambridge
to use electric light. None of the rest have
adopted this modern improvement till quite recently,
and even now it is by no means general.
Peterhouse, however, has kept up its traditions
and occupies a leading place in the history of
scientific progress: for, beside Lord Kelvin, its
books contain the names of the mathematician
Dr Routh* and the well-known Professor
Dewar (*&nbsp;Orchardson).</p>

<p class="dropcap">Loggan, in his invaluable <cite>Cantabrigia Illustrata</cite>,
gives us two views of the court of
Clare, the first a bird’s-eye view of the whole
building, the second an elevation of the north
side, as it was completed at the end of Queen
Anne’s reign. The college had to pass through
some trouble before its buildings were completed.
After its foundation in 1342, a court was built
which lasted till 1525. It was then injured by
fire. The remains were taken down, and preparations
were made for a new building, which
was not begun till 1638, an unfortunate period.
During the Civil Wars, the work was at a
standstill, and the north side, built principally
during the mastership of Dr Samuel Blythe
(1678-1713), was not actually finished till 1715.
Sir George Downing, then a fellow commoner,
contributed to its completion. Later, in 1769,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the present Chapel was built from the designs
of the Master of Caius, Sir James Burrough.
Clare thus presents examples of three distinct
periods in Renaissance work. The earliest
portion is the eastern side of the court with
the gateway, the beauty of which cannot be
too highly praised. The style is the fantastic
Italian Gothic of the period, mixed largely
with classical forms; but the work is free from
what Mr Ruskin would call insincerity. It
is useful to compare it with the chapel at
Peterhouse, consecrated five years before this
was begun. Its characteristics are those of all
the cultured work of the early Stewart period,
and have points in common with a building
like Ingestre Hall near Stafford, which has
unfortunately perished by fire. The south side
is of the same date; the admirable proportions
of this part of the court may be seen from
the grounds of King’s. On the western side
is a building of the time of Charles II. and
James II. Its inner face harmonises fairly
well with the rest, but debased forms, such
as the meaningless broken arch, appear. The
river front is pure Palladian, and the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the order of pilasters which runs through the
two upper stories is very harsh. The northern
face of the court is good, solid, ugly Queen
Anne work, which has, of late years, been
spoiled rather than improved. On this side
is the Hall with great sash-windows, which
the famous Clare creeper does not succeed in
hiding. The Chapel is a plain building of
excellent proportions. Internally, it has most
of the virtues and faults of a Georgian college
chapel: the domical antechapel is an original
feature. On the whole, Clare, which covers
less ground than most colleges, is, architecturally,
among the best; but it is a pity that all was
not carried out in the style of the western side,
which is almost unrivalled in any country, considering
its date. The celebrated bridge, not
unlike the Kitchen Bridge at St John’s, belongs
to the reign of Charles I. and is therefore contemporary
with the older part of the court. It
is well set off by its charming surroundings.
The architect of this bridge, completed in 1640,
was Robert Grumbold, who was master-mason
to the college, and worked at Great St Mary’s
as well as at Clare.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The idea of Clare Hall originated with
Richard de Badew, who, in 1326, while
Chancellor of the University, founded a small
college called University Hall. The first master
of this new foundation was Walter of Thaxted.
But, in the twelfth year of its existence, the
college was burned down. Usually the present
college dates its foundation from 1338, when
the rebuilding began, but the actual date at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which Elizabeth de Burgh took over the
foundation was 1342. She was daughter and
coheir of Gilbert, Count of Clare, Hertford
and Gloucester. Clare lies on the border of
Suffolk and Essex, and the college was essentially
an Essex colony. Two of the early
masters, Walter of Thaxted and William of
Radwinter, came from villages in the same part
of the county, and their names, occurring not far
apart, argue a certain feeling in favour of natives
of the district. There was for a long time a
tradition that Clare Hall was the Soler Hall of
Chaucer’s <cite>Reve’s Tale</cite>, but it is not necessary to
suppose that Chaucer had any particular college
in his mind. His use of the epithet “great”
may point to Clare and distinguish it from the
numerous hostels which were then springing up
in Cambridge; but there can be no certainty on
the point. Chaucer merely borrowed a tale from
Boccaccio and put it into English dress, without
any particular accuracy of detail.</p>

<p>Clare has, on the whole, no very momentous
annals. Hugh Latimer,* the famous Bishop of
Worcester, was a member of this foundation, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
as Fellow of Clare, preached in St Edward’s
Church. Until the foundation of King’s, the
chapel of Clare was the parish church of St
John the Baptist, which stood on the south side
of the college. After St John’s had been
removed to make way for King’s, Clare shared
the possession of St Edward’s Church with
Trinity Hall. Latimer, however, is by no
means the typical theologian of Clare. The
worthies of the college are chiefly religious, and,
a century after, it contributed to the Laudian
revival. When James I. paid his visit to Cambridge,
he was entertained with a comedy at
Clare. The name of the piece was “Ignoramus”
and its author was Mr George Ruggle, one of
the society. It satirised the civil law, which
was then doing its best to oust the canon law,
and James, who always had a keen sympathy for
the obsolete, was hugely delighted. Some years
before, Ruggle had satirised the townsfolk in a
play called <cite>Club-Law</cite>, to which the Corporation
were invited. The absence of good feeling
which marked such an invitation explains the
“town and gown rows” common at this period.</p>

<p>A less festive spirit than George Ruggle was
Nicholas Ferrar,* who appears at Clare about
the same time. Ferrar ranks with Herbert and
Crashaw as the third of the mystics and pietists
whom Cambridge sent out during the seventeenth
century. He became famous as the head of
what he called the “Protestant Nunnery.” It
was established at Little Gidding, an out-of-the-way
village in Huntingdonshire, and consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Ferrar, some members of his family, and some
near relations, who devoted themselves to contemplation
and works of piety. The neighbourhood
of Little Gidding to Cambridge was
probably felt in the University, and there is the
strongest probability that men like Cosin and
Andrewes came over from Cambridge very often,
and went into retreat, as we say, with Ferrar.
A man of this type was the great Peter Gunning,*
Fellow of Clare and Lady Margaret Professor
of Divinity. In 1661 he exchanged his offices
for those of Regius Professor and Master of
Corpus, which he soon left for St John’s.</p>

<p>While the new court of Clare was building,
the Commonwealth came, and with it the mastership
of Ralph Cudworth. This profound thinker
held the chair of Hebrew with his mastership,
and continued to hold it till his death in 1688.
He is certainly one of the most extraordinary
figures of his age at Cambridge, but his history
and that of the band whose leader he was, belong
more properly to the annals of Christ’s. Almost
a contemporary of Cudworth’s was Archbishop
Tillotson,* who, at this date in his career, was a
Puritan, like many of the youth at Cambridge.
He later found his true vocation in the Church
of England, and his sermons have achieved a
greater fame than Cudworth’s abstract treatises,
although their merits are perhaps less.</p>

<p>Theophilus Dillingham succeeded Cudworth,
and was Archdeacon of Bedford as well as
master. He continued the buildings, and a
successful completion was reached under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
subsequent mastership of Samuel Blythe. From
this time forward the history of Clare was
peaceful and monotonous. It produced a very
eccentric son in William Whiston, known as the
admirable translator of Josephus. Whiston was
an astronomer and a proficient mathematician.
He preceded Sir Isaac Newton as Lucasian
Professor, resigning his chair in 1711. He
was always open to the influence of new and
uncommon theories, and died a Baptist with a
strong tendency to Fifth-Monarchy principles.</p>

<p>Clare was the college of that famous statesman,
Thomas Holles Pelham,* Duke of Newcastle,
whose personal peculiarities are ridiculed
in Smollett’s <cite>Humphrey Clinker</cite>. Pelham was
Chancellor of the University from 1748 to
1768, having previously filled the office of High
Steward. His Chancellorship is the last important
event in the history of the College. It has,
since then, under the fortunate and prolonged
rule of four masters, extending over a century
and a half, maintained its ancient prestige, and
now, although one of the smallest of the colleges
in point of buildings, the number of its undergraduates
is exceptionally large and shows no signs
of decreasing. Among its present members it
numbers several men of great eminence, of whom,
to Cambridge men, the most familiar is the present
Woodwardian Professor, Dr McKenny Hughes.</p>

<span class="smaller">PEMBROKE COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Modern architects have taken such delight
in seeing what can be done with Pembroke
that we have scarcely any vestiges of the old
building. The long, low street front of the first
court, a reminiscence of Oxford, with its double
oriel, was refaced in 1726. It was the era of
Gibbs and Burrough, and the treatment is therefore
thoroughly conservative. But since then,
Archbishop Rotherham’s fine, monastic plan
has been ruthlessly spoiled. The oldest existing
part is the Ivy Court, a pretty double range
of rooms at the back of the Hall. The north
side dates from 1633; the south, or Hitcham
Building, from 1659, at which period Rotherham’s
Library still formed the upper storey
of the Hall, and the Chapel stood in the
north-west corner of the first court. Bishop
Wren’s chapel superseded the latter building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after the Restoration. It was consecrated in
1667, and is in curious contrast with the same
prelate’s chapel of 1632 at Peterhouse. His
nephew, the great Sir Christopher Wren, was
the architect of this building and the adjoining
cloister, which is so pleasant a feature of the
western side of the court. Wren’s genius is
clearly visible in the stately unpretentious exterior;
but inside, the chapel is cold and ineffective.
Stained glass of the type which has
been employed at the east end of St Paul’s
Cathedral, is wanted to complete the design.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Pembroke escaped Essex and Wilkins, but
it can hardly be congratulated on what it has
acquired instead. The south side of the old
court has perished; the quaint two-storied
building which contained the Hall and Library,
has disappeared, and, instead, we have the
modern Hall, a very insignificant Gothic apartment
quite out of keeping with the traditions of
Pembroke. Mr Waterhouse’s street front, south
of the chapel, is quite the worst modern building
in Cambridge so far as appearance goes; his
library and clock-tower are, fortunately, in a not
very obtrusive position. Of late years, Mr G.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
G. Scott has built a very pretty court in a French
Renaissance style at the back of the college,
where Downing Street meets Tennis Court Lane,
but, in building the Laboratory opposite in precisely
the same style, he has committed an error
which he would have done well to avoid. This
court belongs to 1883; the Master’s Lodge,
between it and the rest of the college, is by
Waterhouse, and was finished ten years earlier.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“O Domus antiqua et religiosa!” said
Queen Elizabeth, as she passed by the
gates of Pembroke Hall. Very few colleges
deserve the epithet better, for Pembroke has
been one of the most religious of all Cambridge
foundations, and its history is closely connected
with the Church. Like Clare, Pembroke owes
its origin to a woman. Marie de St Paul,
daughter of Guy, Count of St Paul and Châtillon,
married Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke.
There is a legend that the Earl was killed at
a tournament on his wedding day, and Gray
embodied the tradition in his noble Installation
Ode—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">“Sad Châtillon, on her bridal morn,</div>
<div class="verse">That wept her princely love.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">History, however, has made short work with
this story. At all events, after her husband’s
death, the Countess retired from the world, and,
among other charitable works, founded Pembroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Hall or, as she called it, the Hall of Valence-Mary.
This name did not continue long in
use; the college was very soon known, on the
analogy of Clare, as Pembroke Hall, and the title
of College was given to it in the last century.
The foundation dates from 1347, when a Master,
fifteen scholars and four Bible-clerks were established
on the present site. Robert de Thorpe
was first master.</p>

<p>Pembroke is intimately connected with the
revival of learning in England. Henry VI.
contributed generously to the foundation, and
practically set it upon a new footing. Laurence
Booth, who became master in 1450 and held
the office until his death, was a man of great
learning. His ecclesiastical promotion was rapid;
he became Bishop of Durham in 1457, and
Archbishop of York in 1476. Thomas Rotherham*
succeeded him as Archbishop of York and
Master of Pembroke. Rotherham, whose actual
surname was Scott, was one of the most active
promoters of learning in England. He had previously
filled the sees of Rochester and Lincoln,
and was Archbishop of York for twenty-one
years. While Bishop of Lincoln, he had built
the east side of the University Library, and he
became the second founder of Lincoln College
at Oxford. As Lord Chancellor of England,
his political career was stormy. Fuller, in speaking
of his library at Pembroke, says “Many
have mistaken this for the performance of
Richard the Third, merely because his Crest
the <em>Boar</em> is set up therein. Whereas the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is that <em>Rotheram</em> having felt the sharp Tuskes of
that <em>Boar</em> (when imprisoned by the aforesaid
King for resigning the Great Seal of England to
Queen Elizabeth, the relict of King Edward
the Fourth) advanced his arms thereon that he
might ingratiate himself.” Rotherham fell on
more peaceful days when Henry VII. came to
the throne. He resigned the mastership in 1488,
and died of the plague at Cawood in 1501.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the next master but two,
Richard Foxe (*&nbsp;copy of Oxford pictures)
founded Corpus Christi College at Oxford,
just as Rotherham had re-founded Lincoln.
He was at that time Master of Pembroke
and Bishop of Winchester. Foxe was one of
the greatest prelates of that great age. His
benefactions to learning were innumerable and
priceless; three colleges at Oxford and three at
Cambridge count him among their benefactors;
his splendid chantry at Winchester, one of the
finest pieces of Renaissance sculpture which we
possess, is entirely characteristic of this princely
ecclesiastic. His enlightened religious views
made him the friend and patron of the great
scholars who flourished during the reign of
Henry VII. He was also remarkable for his
political activity; he was the chief agent in the
establishment of the Tudor dynasty, and was one
of the supporters of the throne against Perkin
Warbeck’s rebellion. Ford, in his historical
drama of <cite>Perkin Warbeck</cite>, drew Foxe’s character
with admirable force. He died in 1528, old
and almost blind, but still retaining all his vigour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and adhering to his bishoprick with great tenacity.
Foxe may be regarded as one of our earliest and
wisest Reformers: he died too early for the
final quarrel with Rome, but there can hardly
be any doubt that he would have exerted his
influence to prevent a formal breach.</p>

<p>A reformer of a different kind was Nicholas
Ridley,* master from 1540 to 1553, and Bishop
of London during the last three of these thirteen
years. It is easy to see the tendencies which
the enthusiasm of Rotherham and Foxe for the
New Learning had directed, in the fact that
Bradford* and Rogers, also martyrs for Protestantism,
were members of this college. After
Elizabeth’s accession, Edmund Grindal,* a Protestant
of a somewhat extreme type, became
master for three years, during which, like Ridley,
he held the see of London. He resigned the
mastership in 1562. In 1570 he was translated
from London to York, and in 1575 became
Archbishop of Canterbury. His successor at
Pembroke was the equally famous Matthew
Hutton, a learned theologian. His life was
closely connected with Cambridge; he took his
bachelor’s degree in 1551, and ten years later,
became Margaret Professor. Becoming head of
Pembroke in the following year, he obtained the
Regius Professorship of Divinity. He also was
married twice to ladies of the neighbourhood.
His first wife, Katherine Fulmetby, was niece to
Bishop Goodrich of Ely; his second, Beatrice
Fincham, also came from Ely. In 1567 he was
made Dean of York and left Pembroke. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
preferment was almost entirely due to his scholastic
disputations before Elizabeth on her visit
to Cambridge. While at York, he married a
third time, with the true zeal of a post-Reformation
prelate for the married state. He was made
Bishop of Durham in 1589 and was translated
to York in 1594. His effigy, brilliantly painted
and attired in the costume of an Elizabethan
prelate, stands upright against the south wall of
the choir at York Minster.</p>

<p>Whitgift’s mastership, lasting for a few months
in 1567, gives another Archbishop to Pembroke.
But he soon left the college for Trinity. Twenty-two
years later, Lancelot Andrewes* became
master. As Bishop successively of Chichester,
Ely and Winchester, his name is familiar to
students of the Laudian movement. He was
one of those great men who, by their spirituality
rather than their energy, vindicated the Church
of England from Papal claims on one side and
from Genevan doctrine on the other. He is
buried, as is well known, in the Collegiate
Church of St Saviour at Southwark. His
influence is noticeable in the characters of his
immediate successors. Samuel Harsnet, master
from 1605 to 1616, was also Bishop of Chichester
from 1609 to 1619 and of Norwich from 1619
to 1629; and distinguished himself in all these
offices by his peaceful and devout spirit. Nicholas
Felton,* Bishop of Bristol, was master from
1616 to 1618, and Bishop of Ely from
1619 to 1628. His next successor but one,
Benjamin Laney,* was a stout Royalist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was conspicuous for his fidelity to the exiled
King during the Commonwealth. At the
Restoration, he received much recompense. He
was made Bishop of Peterborough in 1660,
Bishop of Lincoln in 1663, and Bishop of Ely
in 1667. This unique example of promotion
in the Eastern sees closes the list of Pembroke
bishops for some time. Since then, the most
famous prelate connected with the college has
been Edward Maltby,* Bishop of Chichester
in 1831 and of Durham from 1836 to 1856.
He was the first of the Bishops of Durham
under the regulations by which at the death of
Bishop Van Mildert, the Prince-Bishoprick was
finally disestablished.</p>

<p>While these “men of much motion and
promotion” were occupying the mastership of
the college, the foundation was not without its
famous sons. They are not, however, very
many, and the chief lustre of the college seems
to have found its centre in the master. Richard
Crashaw was in residence here for some time,
doubtless attracted by the saintly fame of the
masters of the Stewart epoch. But undoubtedly
the greatest son of the college is Edmund
Spenser,* who entered the house probably
during Hutton’s mastership. Of this splendid
name Pembroke may well be proud, although it
has no very intimate relation with the life of the
University. Bishop Matthew Wren,* Master
of Peterhouse, was a fellow here. His benefactions
are remarkable; they include the fine
chapel. He also bequeathed his silver mitre to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the College; and this, although somewhat ugly
in itself, is one of the most valuable pieces of
plate in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Passing over the age of Anne and George I.
we come to the long mastership of Dr Roger
Long (*&nbsp;Benj. Wilson) who ruled the college
from 1733 to 1770. Long became Lowndean
Professor of Astronomy in 1750. His astronomical
studies were commemorated at Pembroke
by a hollow sphere of metal, which had a diameter
of eighteen feet and was a complete guide to the
solar system. It was contained in a building
which terminated the north side of the second
court, but it was destroyed in 1871. Dr Long
was also much interested in the liberal arts; he
was a musician and mechanic; he was also a
wit of a not very refined order. His “Musick
Speech” delivered in Great St Mary’s at the
Commencement of 1714, is quoted in Mr J.
W. Clark’s book on Cambridge. He was then
fellow of his college. As master, he was a
friend of Thomas Gray. When that sensitive
poet left Peterhouse, he met with a royal reception
at Pembroke, which proves that the
college was progressive in the direction of
culture. Gray joined the society, and resided
in the second court for fifteen years. His rooms
were famous for their comfort in a day when no
one thought of furnishing a room with more than
a table and a few chairs, and the blue pots in his
window were the wonder of Cambridge. He
was devoted to his adopted college, and the
influence of its structure may be traced in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
passages of his poems. From 1768 to 1771,
he held the chair of Modern History. There
are one or two portraits of him in the college.
That by Benjamin Wilson, now in the Combination
Room, was painted after his death.
Another poet, his close friend and personal admirer,
William Mason (*&nbsp;Reynolds) belonged to
the society for many years, and died in 1797.</p>

<p>If among poets Pembroke claims Spenser, she
can also claim William Pitt among statesmen.
There are two portraits of the illustrious Prime
Minister, one, by Harlow, in the Hall; the
other, by Gainsborough, in the Combination
Room. Pitt is, however, the property not so
much of a single college as of the University,
whose politics have been largely directed by his
memory. His name is preserved in the Pitt Club,
which was established soon after his death and
took his coat of arms. It is to-day the best
social club in the University, and has rooms in
Jesus Lane. In later years, Pembroke elected
John Couch Adams (*&nbsp;Herkomer), the discoverer
of Neptune, to a fellowship, thus adding to a list
which, if not long, is at least highly distinguished.
Under the mastership of Dr Searle (*&nbsp;Ouless),
who was elected in 1880, it has become an
exceedingly popular college, and its numbers are
very largely augmented. Dr Edward Bickersteth,
the late Bishop of the Church of England in
Japan, was among the most celebrated of its
recent members, and held an Honorary Fellowship.
The present Bishop of Wakefield is the
latest addition to its roll of prelates.</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">GONVILLE AND CAIUS COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">The arrangement of buildings at Caius is rather
curious, and no Cambridge college has been
so transformed since its foundation. The chapel
is between the two lesser courts; the hall is at
the back of everything, and its position is far
from obvious. Caius may be said to consist of
two halves: the first half, to the east, borders
Trinity Street, and is the New Court; the
second and westerly half is an oblong bounded
on three sides by narrow lanes and on the other
by the rest of the college. This second half is
again split into two halves, the northern of which,
nearest Trinity Lane, is Gonville Court, and
represents the ancient college removed here in
1353 from the other end of King’s Parade.
Beneath its somewhat modern front an immense
quantity of the original work still exists, and
fourteenth-century windows have been discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The old hall and chapel have
disappeared, although part of the present chapel
may belong to the original buildings. Caius,
however, in refounding the college, altered
everything. He built an additional court, south
of the ancient college. This, too, has been
refaced, and is, for the most part, a comfortable
quadrangle of Queen Anne date. But the gates
which Caius, giving play to a strange fancy,
built for his college, are still entire. His Gate
of Humility, a mere postern in the outer buildings,
exists no longer; but Mr Waterhouse
preserved the idea in his new building, and
recently his gate has, in accordance with the
founder’s design, been made once again the
principal entrance. The Gate of Virtue,
leading from the new court into Caius Court,
is a tall Italian building, in which Gothic and
Renaissance forms are most curiously blended.
The Italian appearance of the design is due,
no doubt, to the corner turret, which introduces
a very picturesque element into a simple plan.</p>

<p>While the Gate of Virtue subordinates its
ornament to general effect, the last gate, the
Gate of Honour, leading appropriately to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Senate House and schools, attracts by beauty
of detail. It was finished in 1574, the year
after Caius’ death, and its design, the heavy
architrave with an Ionic order, and the hexagonal,
domed structure at the top, is purely
classical. It is the most charming building of
its date in England, and is a good instance of
that love of mere fancy which marks the builders
of the late Italian Renaissance. Caius’ architect
was a certain Theodore Have of Cleves in the
Rhenish provinces, who also remodelled the
chapel between this and Gonville’s court, and
probably designed the sarcophagus in which
Caius is buried. The bell-tower of the chapel,
which agrees very well with the two gateways,
is comparatively new. It is worth while to
enter the chapel, which, although, after numerous
alterations, it is of no particular date or style,
has a very pleasant interior, and, in addition to
Caius’ monument, contains that of Dr Perse, the
founder of the Perse Free School in Cambridge.
This excellent gentleman, who died in 1617,
built most of the original entrance court of the
college, in which Caius’ Gate of Humility was
incorporated. In Loggan’s beautiful view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Caius, these buildings seem to have been of
the same style as those in the second court of
St John’s College, the style of which Ralph
Symons built so many delightful examples
in Cambridge. They belong to 1617. The
portion of this court south of the Gate of
Humility was built in 1619, in accordance
with the will of a late master, Dr Legge.</p>

<p>In 1719, the older courts were faced and the
chapel was newly decorated. This work was
continued at intervals through the century. Mr
(afterwards Sir James) Burrough was a fellow
in these days, and was the leading spirit in the
work. The college remained untouched until
the mastership of the late Dr Guest. Then,
in 1854, Salvin built the Hall, whose exterior
is as hideous as the interior, with its fine open
timber roof, is imposing and beautiful. In 1867
Mr Waterhouse entirely rebuilt Perse’s court,
and, in the following year, added an apse to the
chapel. His court has given a new feature to
Cambridge, certainly. But, where colleges are
concerned, Mr Waterhouse is not happy, and
this huge pile, with its square windows, its
pyramidal tower, medallions, and rows of waterspouts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
would make a praiseworthy bank or
hotel, but, in its present position, is painfully
incongruous.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Very shortly after Marie de Valence had
founded Pembroke, Edmund Gonville,
rector of Terrington St Clement’s in Norfolk,
founded Gonville Hall for the instruction of
twenty scholars in dialect and other sciences.
He found a site for his hall in what is now Free
School Lane, just behind St Botolph’s Church.
The foundation took place in 1348, and, during
Gonville’s lifetime, the name given to the hall
was “The Hall of the Annunciation of the
Blessed Virgin.” But Gonville died in 1351,
when his executor, the famous William Bateman,
Bishop of Norwich, removed the buildings and
placed them opposite his own college of Trinity
Hall. Henceforward, the college was known
as Gonville Hall, and the old name was retained
when Caius re-founded it. The small society—for
the college was at first very poor—took
possession of its new tenements in 1353, when
William de Rougham became master. The
previous master of the house in Free School
Lane was John Colton, who became Primate of
Ireland; and among the masters of Gonville
Hall we find the names of John Rickingale,
Bishop of Chichester in 1426, and John Skippe,
Bishop of Hereford in 1539.</p>

<p>It was during the mastership of Skippe’s predecessor,
William Bokenham, that John Caius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
entered the college as an undergraduate. After
he had taken his degree he was for a few years
Principal of Physwick Hostel, a small house
affiliated to Gonville Hall. He left Cambridge,
however, about 1540, and travelled to foreign
universities, studying medicine at Padua and
other academies. He was a man of culture,
and his taste was doubtless stimulated by the
splendid productions of the Italian Renaissance.
We may, in fact, regard him as one of the
greatest English humanists, and, like so many
of them, as one of the greatest benefactors to
his university. On his return to England he
practised as a physician, and received the appointment
of court physician to Edward VI. and,
afterwards, to Queen Mary. In 1555, he was
elected President of the College of Physicians.
Having thus risen to considerable eminence, he
determined to do something for Gonville Hall.
Philip and Mary granted him letters patent in
1557, with which he refounded the college.
In this way he gave that impetus to medical
study which has since made Caius pre-eminently
a doctor’s college. His beautiful buildings are
sufficient testimony to the elegant taste which he
had matured in Italy. Thomas Bacon, master
of Gonville Hall and first master of the new
foundation, died in 1559, and the society elected
Caius to the mastership. At first he was reluctant
to accept the dignity, and prevailed so
far as to refuse his income as master. His
mastership lasted until his death in 1573. He
was one of the most disinterested of all Cambridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
benefactors, and his learning and talents
are beyond praise. One odd feature of his
career, which is very characteristic of the uncritical
spirit of the time, is his dispute with Dr
Key of Oxford as to the relative antiquity of
the two universities. To some astonishing legend
of Key’s, he replied that Cambridge was founded
in the year 3538 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> by one Cantaber, a Spanish
prince, alleging many weighty statements on behalf
of his accurate chronology. His <cite>History of
Cambridge</cite> contains more trustworthy information
than this, but he was singularly prone to the
acceptation of spurious etymologies and vain
traditions. His contemporaries held him to be
something of an atheist, and complained that he
showed “a perverse stomach to professors of the
gospel.” This probably means little more than
that he was content with the old religion. He
died away from Cambridge, but his body was
brought from London to be buried. It was met
at Trumpington Ford by the Vice-Chancellor
and a procession, who escorted it into Cambridge
with almost royal honours.</p>

<p>Among other gifts to the college, Caius left
the silver mace encircled with serpents, which is
called <i lang="la">Caduceus prudentis gubernatoris</i>. It was
directed to be carried in procession before the
master with the <i lang="la">Liber Cognitionis</i> and the <i lang="la">Pulvinar
reverentiae</i>. There are three portraits of
Caius in various parts of the college. That in
the Hall, which represents him holding a pink,
is the best.</p>

<p>A notable son of Gonville Hall was Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Thomas Gresham, well known as the founder of
the Royal Exchange. He died in 1579, so
that he had probably taken his degree before
Caius’ time. Caius was succeeded in the mastership
by Dr Legge, a lawyer and Master in
Chancery, who was also Regius Professor of
Civil Law. In his day came into residence
William Harvey of Folkestone, one of the great
glories of the college. His discovery of the
circulation of the blood created a revolution in
medical science. There are three portraits of
Harvey in Caius: one of them, in the Master’s
Lodge, is attributed to Rembrandt; another in
the Combination Room, is a replica of the picture
at the Royal College of Physicians. Another
great doctor, John Gostlin,* Regius Professor
of Physic, became master in 1618. He is said
to have objected to the wearing of boots as
“more fit for gallants than for civil students.”
He also gave the Bull Inn, which was his
property, to Catharine Hall.</p>

<p>If Caius has its doctors, it has also its prelates.
William Linwood, Lord Keeper under Henry
VI., and Bishop of St David’s in 1442, is commemorated
by one of the medallions on the west
front. A famous name among others is that
of Nicholas Shaxton, Bishop of Salisbury in
1535. The long mastership of Thomas Batchcroft,*
who was ejected by the Parliamentary
Commissioners and restored in 1660, was distinguished
by the residence of Jeremy Taylor.
This great divine’s father was a barber in
Cambridge, and sent his son to Dr Perse’s new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Free School. Naturally, as a scholar brought
up at a school which had been founded from
Caius, Taylor became an undergraduate at Caius.
He was a precocious theologian, and early
attracted the notice of Laud, who transferred
him to Oxford and procured him a fellowship
at All Souls’. He became Bishop of Down
and Connor, and died at Lisburn in 1667.
Among theologians his name stands very high,
and, as a writer of English, he is in his own style
unsurpassed. Cosin also, a no less illustrious
example of piety and devout Churchmanship,
was bred at Caius, before he became Master of
Peterhouse. Both Taylor and Cosin figure in
the medallions of the façade. The portrait of
Taylor in the Hall is a copy of his picture at
All Souls’. There is also a portrait of Cosin
painted in 1666. Other prelates of this period
are Francis Marsh, Bishop of Limerick and
Archbishop of Dublin, Hartstrong, Bishop of
Ossory, and Francis White, Bishop, first of
Norwich, and then of Ely. To much the same
date belongs Judge Jeffreys. A very disreputable
undergraduate was Titus Oates, of whom a
vehement writer says that he was “a liar from
the beginning, cheated his tailor of a gown, which
he denied with horrid imprecations.” His
career at Cambridge had a sudden end, but he
managed to obtain a doctor’s degree at Salamanca.
Thomas Shadwell, who is famous as
one of Dryden’s <i lang="fr">bêtes noires</i>, was also a member
of Caius.</p>

<p>Robert Brady,* Keeper of the Records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and Regius Professor of Physic, was master for
forty years after Batchcroft’s death. He was
a supporter of the royal prerogative in its most
extreme form, and wrote a History of England
to prove his views. Two clergymen were
educated at Caius in his time; Prince, who
wrote the Worthies of Devon, and Jeremy
Collier, the stout antagonist of Restoration
drama. Another long mastership was that of
Sir Thomas Gooch,* from 1716 to 1754,
who, during the same period, was Bishop successively
of Bristol, Norwich and Ely. He was
succeeded in 1754 by Sir James Burrough, who,
for many years before, had interested himself in
the architectural condition of Cambridge, and
had had a hand in altering almost every college.
He was not an unsuccessful architect, although
an amateur, but his work is very unequal and it
degenerated with the taste of the epoch. Although
one of the best known masters, as far as Cambridge
is concerned, there is no portrait of him
in the college. Another Cambridge architect,
William Wilkins, was also a Caius man.</p>

<p>Burrough’s successor was Dr John Smith,
afterwards Lowndean Professor of Astronomy,
who lived till 1795. There is a portrait of him
by Reynolds in the Master’s Lodge. Later
masters have not been so famous. Mr Clark
tells us that Dr Benedict Chapman (*&nbsp;Philips)
was the last head of a house who rode out in
top-boots. Perhaps the name on which Cambridge
men will dwell with most affection in
connexion with Caius is that of John Hookham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Frere, whose translations of Aristophanes have a
place in English literature. The mastership of
Dr Ferrers,* which began in 1880, has been
marked by great progress. The college is no
longer exclusively medical, but is winning yearly
honours in all the schools, and it has created
a good precedent by granting fellowships as a
reward of proficiency rather than of mere academic
distinction. It has, however, produced, all
through its history, great members of every profession.
Among its lawyers have been Lord
Chancellor Thurlow* and Baron Alderson.*
And of its divines, while it reckons the late Dr
Harvey Goodwin, Bishop of Carlisle, among the
number, the last, but not the least, is the heroic
Charles Frederick Mackenzie,* first Bishop
of the Universities Mission to Central Africa.
Its latest living bishop is Dr Wallis, who was
consecrated Bishop of Wellington in New
Zealand a year or two ago.</p>

<span class="smaller">TRINITY HALL</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Long the lawyers’ college, Trinity Hall
maintains a staid legal appearance. Its
present arrangement is essentially modern, and
the earliest remaining portion is the ivy-covered
range of chambers forming the northern side of
the Garden Court. This is not earlier than
1560, but, as at Caius, much of the interior
work of the main court is original. In the
upper storey of this range is the primitive
Library, fitted in the sixteenth century with
low bookshelves, the tops of which form a double
reading desk. This very comfortable arrangement
has been followed in the small bookshelves
of many of the other libraries. The bulk of
the College, including the entrance courts and
the small quadrangle, was entirely remodelled
in the last century, during the mastership of Sir
Nathaniel Lloyd (1710-35) and Sir Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Simpson (1735-64). The Chapel, south of
the large court (an unusual position) belongs to
1729, and the Hall on the west side to 1743.
Its interior is very creditable to Georgian taste,
although not positively faultless. In 1852, the
façade of the college was burned down. The
present front is due to Salvin, who built the
neighbouring hall of Caius much about the same
time. The old gate of the college, which
opened into the smaller court, is still commemorated
by an opening in the wall, affording
a picturesque view of the ivy-covered interior.
To a later period belong the new buildings in
the Garden Court. The Tutor’s House, of
white stone, by Mr W. M. Fawcett, is not
exactly in harmony with Messrs Grayson &amp;
Ould’s brick building on the north side, but
the latter has been arranged so as to slope obliquely
northward, and front the garden; and
a too obvious discord has thus been avoided.
In itself, this red-brick work, of a Renaissance
order, is one of the best things in modern
Cambridge, and fulfils, at least from an outside
point of view, all the ideal requirements of a
collegiate building.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">Canon Law, the typical study of the Middle
Ages, is the <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> of Trinity Hall.
William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich, founded
the College of the Scholars of the Holy Trinity
of Norwich in 1350, in order to furnish his
diocese with secular priests. His college occupied
substantially the same ground as it does
to-day. The founder, who also has a claim to
be one of the founders of Caius, did not live long
to enjoy his work. He was sent by Edward
III. on an embassy to Innocent VI., in one
of the numerous attempts at arbitration which
varied the Hundred Years’ War. While engaged
in these negotiations the Bishop died. His
death was due to the climate of Avignon,
which, in that season of plague, was more than
ordinarily pestilent. “Avenio ventosa,” says the
doggrel rhyme, “cum vento fastidiosa, sine vento
venenosa.” Englishmen, with their usual mistrust
of Papal honesty, said that Bateman had
been poisoned. He left his foundations of
Trinity Hall and the new Gonville Hall in a
very incomplete state, and his executor, Archbishop
Simon of Sudbury, although he did what
he could in the way of building, was too much
occupied with his fatal position in the state to
attend closely to the condition of the colleges.
In fact, Trinity Hall, composed of a master,
twenty fellows and three scholars, was very
badly off. Early in the fifteenth century they
complained to Archbishop Arundel of the insufficiency
of their commons, and obtained a
dispensation by which they were empowered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
add twopence for each weekday and a groat on
the Lord’s day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two of the masters of Trinity
Hall are found among the list of bishops. These
were the canonists Robert de Stretton, Bishop
of Lichfield from 1360 to 1386, and Marmaduke
Lumley, Bishop of Lincoln from 1450 to 1452.
In the year 1525, Stephen Gardiner* became
master. He was a native of Bury St Edmund’s
and was a fellow of the college. In 1531, he
was made Bishop of Winchester, but retained
the mastership till his death, esteeming it a refuge
to which, in those troublous times, he could
always retire. He was, nevertheless, a little
out of his reckoning. Although a reformer,
he was of the conservative type and was not a
<i lang="la">persona grata</i> to Edward VI., who deprived him
of both his mastership and bishoprick. His
supplanter at Winchester was John Poynet; at
Trinity Hall he was superseded by Walter
Haddon, reputed to be the best Latinist of his
time. Haddon was Professor of Law and
Rhetoric and Public Orator, and, in addition
to this, with the assistance of Sir John Cheke,
compiled a new code of ecclesiastical law. His
reforming activities gained him the Presidency
of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1552, from
which he retired at Queen Mary’s accession.
He died some years later and is buried in Christ
Church, Newgate Street.</p>

<p>Mary’s reign brought back Gardiner to his
college and diocese. Walter Mowse, the second
Protestant master, was ousted to make way for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the bishop. As Chancellor of England, Gardiner
distinguished himself for his reactionary policy, a
natural course in one who, having done all he
could in the way of reform, knew what gratitude
he had to expect from the other side. He died
in 1555. There is no doubt that he was an
energetic, pushing man who allowed little to
stand in his way, and stories were told of how
he canvassed for the see of Winchester, doing
his best to embitter the last days of Bishop
Foxe. He was the bishop who married Philip
of Spain to Mary in Winchester Cathedral; and
this, with his acts of persecution, have endeared
him to the orthodox English historian. But we
must make allowance for Protestant hatred, and
remember that if such men as Gardiner, Pole,
and Gaspar Contarini had lived a century before,
we should have been spared the irregularities of
the Reformation, while we reaped its advantages.
Gardiner’s chantry-chapel is well known to all
visitors of Winchester Cathedral. There are two
portraits of him in Trinity Hall: one in the Combination
Room, another in the Master’s Lodge.
A somewhat less single-minded ecclesiastic was
Thomas Thirlby,* fellow of the college, and first
and only Bishop of Westminster. He was promoted
in 1550 to Norwich, and to Ely in 1554,
when he, too, gained some reputation as a persecutor
of the new religion. Richard Sampson,
Bishop of Lichfield, belongs also to this period.</p>

<p>Henry Hervey, who followed Gardiner, was
a great builder, and we owe the Library to him.
From his time onward the college was the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
centre of Cambridge, and helped to raise English
law to a position which fully realised Bateman’s
desire that England should not be “out-lawed”
by other countries. As Canon Law became
superseded by Civil Law, the original purpose
of the college and its connexion with Norwich
were quite forgotten. John Cowell, master from
1598 to 1611, was a great foe, however, to Sir
Edward Coke and the common lawyers. His
book on the King’s Prerogative was burned by
order of the House of Commons. Another legal
worthy of the time was Sir Robert Naunton,
Public Orator, and author of <cite>Fragmenta Regalia</cite>,
who had also some connexion with Trinity
College. He is memorable for an insulting remark
which he made to the Spanish Ambassador,
Gondomar, on account of which he was kept a
close prisoner in his own house, stoutly refusing
to apologise.</p>

<p>The Regius Professorship of Civil Law became
the practical monopoly of Trinity Hall in
1666, when Dr John Clark was elected to the
office. It was only on the election of the present
Professor Clark that the succession was broken.
Of these professors, one, Dr George Oxenden,
held the mastership and professorship together.
Meanwhile, we find one or two bishops, notably
William Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln from 1608
to 1614, whose name is familiar to controversialists
on the subject of Anglican Orders. The
beginning of the eighteenth century produced two
more, Adam Otley, Bishop of St David’s and
Richard Reynolds, Bishop of Lincoln. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the same time, Trinity Hall had the honour of
educating Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth Earl
of Chesterfield (*&nbsp;W. Hoare). It would be
interesting to know more about the life of this
celebrated gentleman at Cambridge, but he
doubtless employed his time in picking up miscellaneous
knowledge and laying the foundations
of his delightful style. I forgot to mention that
another famous nobleman was a Trinity Hall
man—Lord Howard of Effingham, who commanded
the English fleet against the Spanish
Armada. In Nathaniel, Lord Crewe,* Bishop
of Durham, the college produced a devout prelate
and Jacobite. He died in his ninetieth year
(1633).</p>

<p>Lawyers of the eighteenth century are absolutely
innumerable. Sir Nathaniel Lloyd,*
master from 1710 to 1735, was King’s Advocate;
his successor, Sir Edward Simpson,*
was Dean of Arches. Sir John Eardley
Wilmot,* Lord Chief Justice of England,
was another noted member of the college. His
life nearly spans the last century. Dr John
Andrews,* Master of Faculties, dying in
1747, left the College £20,000, which was to
be paid after the death of his two sisters and
expended in building new wings to the river.
Dr Samuel Halifax,* Professor of Law
from 1770 to 1782, was clergyman as well as
lawyer. Previously, he had held for two years
the two University Professorships of Arabic.
His elevation to the see of Gloucester in 1781
was a suitable reward of such versatility. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was followed in his Professorship by Dr Joseph
Jowett, who made a garden out of the strip of
ground at the angle formed by the outer walls
of the old court and of the principal quadrangle.
It faced the lane east of the cottage, and excited
some ridicule. Archdeacon Wrangham’s epigram
has been often quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A little garden little Jowett made</div>
<div class="verse">And fenced it with a little palisade;</div>
<div class="verse">But when this little garden made a little talk,</div>
<div class="verse">He changed it to a little gravel walk.</div>
<div class="verse">If you would know the mind of little Jowett,</div>
<div class="verse">This little garden don’t a little show it.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The list of legal celebrities in the last century is
also adorned by the name of Lord Mansfield,
whose bust, by Nollekens, is in the Hall.</p>

<p>We now come to the present century. Sir
Alexander Cockburn (*&nbsp;Watts), Lord Chief
Justice, was a member of the college during the
earlier half, and the name of Sir Herbert Jenner
Fust, master from 1843 to 1852, is also well
known. Sir Henry Maine’s reputation is
European. This great historian, lawyer and
philosopher, occupied the chair of Civil Law
from 1847 to 1854. When, in 1877, Dr
Geldart died, he was elected Master, and died
in 1888. During the last year of his life, he
was Whewell Professor of International Law.
There is a portrait of him in the Hall, by
Lowes Dickinson. Needless to say, Trinity Hall
is represented on the Bench of to-day, and the
Lodge contains two portraits (by Dickinson) of
Mr Justice Romer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Literature pure and simple has never been
well represented at “the Hall.” Thomas Tusser
was educated here, but a great gap exists between
the old-fashioned bucolic poet and the next
writer. The name of Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton
(*&nbsp;copy from Maclise) is, however, not
inconsiderable. His part in nineteenth-century
literature may be very largely ascribed to his
Cambridge associations and friendships. And
the growth of an essentially modern science has
been stimulated by another Trinity Hall man,
Henry Fawcett (*&nbsp;Rathbone), Postmaster
General and Professor of Political Economy
from 1863 to 1884. There is another portrait
of him, by Professor Herkomer, in the Fitzwilliam
Museum. And, speaking of the Fitzwilliam
Museum, it must not be forgotten that
the peer to whom that institution owes its foundation
came from Trinity Hall also.</p>

<p>To the modern undergraduate Trinity Hall
is known chiefly as the head of the river, a
position which, until the present year, has been
for some time its monopoly. However, it is
also well known in the schools, and not only in
the school of law. Under Dr Latham (*&nbsp;Holl
and Dickinson) the college has increased in
popularity, and, both in size and importance,
has attained a place in the first rank of colleges.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">One of the prettiest spots in the whole
University is the tiny medieval court on
the north side of Corpus. You have only to
turn your back on the ugly Hall, and look
at three sides of a venerable, low quadrangle
clothed with ivy and stained with age, and
you can imagine yourself back in the days of
the Edwards, when the pious members of the
Cambridge benefit societies founded the college.
Times have changed, and the court has been
repaired fairly often; but the place retains its
medieval flavour. There is still the gallery
which communicated between the college and
St Bene’t’s Church, while St Bene’t’s was the
college chapel; with the aid of a key, you
may go straight from under the roof of Corpus
into church, without leaving cover. And, in
one corner of the court, the kitchen, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
great spit revolving in the draught, is a continual
source of interest to all visitors. However,
medieval Corpus was never very conspicuous,
and, like most things medieval, it grew incommodious.
Mr William Wilkins, an architect of
some knowledge, who had taken his degree at
Caius, was selected in 1823 to renew Corpus in
the Gothic taste, then becoming fashionable. His
design, which he executed between 1823 and
1827, was highly praised, and during the next
ten years he left some notable marks of his hand
in Cambridge. The great court of Corpus is
a singular instance of the fluctuation of taste.
What was then considered handsome—it was
certainly audacious—is to-day an eye-sore. The
proportions of the great court are noble, and
everything is conceived on a grand scale. The
Hall and Library are both fine apartments, and the
Chapel is commanding; but the whole building is
shallow, and its detail is flimsy and jejune. All
Wilkins’ work, here, at King’s and at Trinity,
deserves careful study; for it shows how the architects
of the first half of the century, with the
experience of past ages at their command, failed
even in the elementary matter of imitation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">Corpus has the singular distinction of having
been founded by a Gild. The Gild or
Benefit Society was an important institution in
medieval Cambridge, and each church had one
attached to it. Somewhere towards the end of
the thirteenth century, when the festival of
Corpus Christi was become a recognised feast
of the Church, a society of this kind was founded
in the parish of St Bene’t, and took the title of
Corpus Christi in honour of the Blessed Sacrament.
What induced the corporation to found
a college is unknown; its action is at all events
a testimony to the love of learning which was
spreading at this time among the middle classes.
In 1352, it obtained a charter from Edward III.
for the foundation of a college. The alderman
of the Gild at this date was Henry, Duke of
Lancaster, cousin to the King. One gild,
however, was not sufficient to carry out the work
of itself, and the Gild of Corpus Christi achieved
its desire by uniting itself with the Gild of Our
Lady, which was connected with St Mary’s by
the Market, the present University Church. To
this union the College owes its coat of arms. In
two out of the four quarters we see the “pelican
in her piety,” the emblem of the Blessed Sacrament;
in the other two are the lilies emblematic
of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Another interesting
person connected with the foundation is John
Goldcorne, an ex-alderman of the Gild of Corpus
Christi. He had generously given some of his
property to Bishop Bateman when the bishop
removed Caius College to its present site. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gave Corpus the fine drinking-horn which still is
the chief piece of plate in the rich collection belonging
to the house. It was probably the horn
used at feasts of the Gild; it is one of the
best specimens of the kind in existence.</p>

<p>Thomas of Eltisley, a village between Cambridge
and St Neots, was the first master. Like
most other colleges, its medieval history is not
very extraordinary. Like most other colleges,
too, its scholars “kept” their chapels in a
parish church, the adjacent church of St Bene’t.
College and church have always been closely
connected, and even to-day, when the college
has ceased to bear its familiar name of Bene’t
College, the advowson of St Bene’t’s is in its
gift. In process of time, it built the south
chancel aisle, which it reserved for itself. This
was divided into two stories, an upper and an
under, and was entered from the gallery which
still exists between the church and the old court.
Finally, in the sixteenth century, Sir Nicholas
Bacon,* the famous Lord Keeper, who had
been educated at Corpus, gave the structure of a
chapel. This was built almost on the site of
the present one. It is characteristic of the age
that, to build this chapel, stone was taken from
the dissolved abbey of Thorney and from Barnwell
Priory.</p>

<p>Matthew Parker, master from 1544 to 1553,
was the great ornament of the college at this
period. He is more famous as Archbishop of
Canterbury than as a don, but Corpus holds his
name in great honour. His great collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
manuscripts is preserved in the Library. The
bequest was accompanied by one of those odd
provisions by which benefactors ensured the
jealous care of their possessions after their death.
If twenty-five manuscripts are lost, the collection
is to go to Caius; if Caius is guilty of neglect,
it passes to Trinity Hall. The provision is
rigidly attended to, and the inspection of the
manuscripts is an affair of great circumstance,
for which the presence of the librarian, a fellow
and a scholar is necessary. Perhaps the most
historical document in the Library is the original
draft of the Thirty-Nine Articles. Parker also
left some very valuable plate to the college, cups
and apostle-spoons. There is a portrait of him
in the Hall, and another in the Master’s
Lodge.</p>

<p>Corpus has a distinguished roll of Elizabethan
worthies. Besides Sir Nicholas Bacon and
Parker, we find the names of two dramatists,
Christopher Marlowe, one of the greatest of all,
and Giles Fletcher, the collaborator of Beaumont.
The father of the latter was also a member of
the college, and became Bishop, first of Bristol,
then of London. George Wishart, the Scottish
martyr, was here at some time early in the
sixteenth century. In 1590 John Jegon* became
master. Afterwards, as Bishop of Norwich,
Jegon was not a great success: as Master of
Corpus his strictness made him unpopular. There
is a story that he fined some of the scholars for a
breach of rules, and applied the proceeds to the
repair of the college. One of the delinquents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
afterwards wrote on a wall of the college this
couplet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Dr Jegon, Bene’t College Master,</div>
<div class="verse">Broke the scholars’ heads and gave the wall a plaster.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Beneath this elegant conceit Jegon wrote a
distich of his own.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Knew I but the wag that wrote this verse in bravery,</div>
<div class="verse">I’d commend him for his wit, but whip him for his knavery.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Jegon was Vice-Chancellor from 1596 to 1601,
and his arms appear on the plaster ceiling of
the old Senate House, now incorporated in
the University Library. His brother Thomas
succeeded him at Corpus and was also Vice-Chancellor
in 1609. Both brothers died in
1618.</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth Richard Love*
was Master, and was also Dean of Ely as long
as deaneries were suffered to exist. At the
Restoration, Peter Gunning became master for
a year, and then passed to St John’s. Gunning’s
part in Church History is well known, and his
short residence may be esteemed an honourable
item in the history of the college. Seven years
after his time, another scholar of repute became
master, John Spencer (*&nbsp;Van der Myn), Dean
of Ely, and author of a book <cite>De Legibus Hebraeorum</cite>.
Corpus has always been rich in ecclesiastics.
It produced a second Archbishop of
Canterbury in Thomas Tenison* who is famous
for his interest in education and his benefactions to
schools. In the next generation another Primate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Thomas Herring,* came from Corpus. An Archbishop
of York belonging to the foundation was
Richard Sterne, afterwards Master of Jesus and
grandfather of the great sentimentalist. Matthias
Mawson,* master from 1724 to 1744, was
elevated in 1740 to the Bishoprick of Chichester
and translated in 1754 to Ely. On the other
hand, Samuel Wesley was also at Corpus, so
that modern Methodism, the creation of his
famous sons, may look with reverence upon the
college.</p>

<p>The Master’s Lodge contains a very complete
series of portraits, but the later masters are none
of them very noticeable. It cannot be said that
the heads of houses during the early part of the
present century were interesting beings, although
they themselves were not without positive convictions
on the point. Dr John Lamb (*&nbsp;Sir
W. Beechey), was master from 1822 to 1850,
and supplemented his office with the Deanery of
Bristol. His mastership was signalised by the
entire rebuilding of the college under William
Wilkins. Whether the copy of Raffaelle’s
School of Athens (attributed to Poussin) which
this radical builder presented to the college is
sufficient compensation for the damage inflicted
in a matter of doubt. The present buildings
have nourished some excellent scholars. Of
living celebrities the three brothers Perowne may
be mentioned—Bishop, Master, and Archdeacon.
The portrait of Dr E. H. Perowne in the Hall
is by Rudolph Lehmann; that of his brother,
the Bishop of Worcester, is by the Hon. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Collier. The late librarian, Samuel S. Lewis
(*&nbsp;Brock) was a world-wide authority on gems.
His collection, containing many of the finest
engraved gems existing, now belongs to the
college, forming a treasure little inferior to
Archbishop Parker’s manuscripts. And, turning
to the religious memories of Corpus, no one who
appreciates a life of entire self-sacrifice and
devotion will fail to pay a tribute to the portrait
of Thomas Ragland, Fellow of the College,
and missionary to Tinnevelly. It will be seen
that the history of Corpus is throughout almost
entirely ecclesiastical, and it is still a favourite
college for undergraduates who wish to proceed
to Holy Orders. Among its latest honours has
been the elevation of its librarian, Dr Harmer,
to the Bishoprick of Adelaide. Although one
of the smaller foundations, its priceless collections
give Corpus an importance second to that of very
few colleges, while the unique history of its
foundation singles it out from the rest.</p>

<span class="smaller">KING’S COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Henry VI. is the most famous of the
founders of colleges in Cambridge, but his
plan has been adhered to least of all. King’s
has gone through several vicissitudes. The
magnificent chapel stood south, not north, of
the original college. That college was to have
consisted of four courts; the fourth was to be
on the other side of the river, and a covered
bridge was to lead to it, as to the present fourth
court of St John’s. As at Wykeham’s Oxford
College, with which King’s has so many points
of resemblance, the west end of the chapel was
to be supplemented with cloisters and an ample
tower. Only one court was built, which now
is part of the University Library. The college
has been transferred to the other side of the
chapel, and consists of a scattered series of more
or less modern buildings. From some points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of view, the change is to be regretted, but, had
it not been made, we should have lost the
unique view of King’s and Clare from the
Backs, which disputes the honours of Cambridge
with the Trinity lime walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">King’s College</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>King’s Chapel was very nearly a century in
building. Henry VI. laid its foundation stone on
July 25th, 1446, and the workmen continued
at it till 1479 or thereabout. Edward IV.
gave £1000 towards it, but the works lay
idle till 1508, when Henry VII. came forward
with £5000. Another £5000 was paid over
by his executors in 1513, and in 1515 the
chapel stood for the first time as it stands now.
The stained glass was added under two contracts,
one bearing date 1516, the second 1526.
In 1536 the screen and most of the stalls were
added, and in 1774 Essex spoiled the east end
with some inferior Gothic wood carving, which,
fortunately, has lately been removed.</p>

<p>This is the history of the main fabric. As
a building, its faults are shared in common by
all its contemporaries. It is possible to accuse
King’s Chapel of monotony, and it must be
confessed that its constant repetition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
same ornaments all over its surface shows
a lack of invention. But it may be said
without any doubt that no building raised in
Europe after 1500 is so pure a specimen of
Gothic as this; and, with all its faults, and
especially its strong tendency to mere bigness,
it stands first in beauty among those of our
churches which are not cathedrals—that is, after
Westminster Abbey. The exterior, with its
corner turrets, its row of tall windows, its
flanking chantries and its immense buttresses,
is simple in design and gorgeous in execution.
The north and south porches, which are exceptionally
good for their date, afford a certain
relief from the general sameness. Internally,
the charm of the general effect is extraordinary,
and every Cambridge man must have felt it at
some time or other. Its length is 316 feet,
its breadth 45½ feet, its height 78 feet; and
this vast area is flooded with the exquisite
colours of the stained windows. Even the
roof, an unbroken expanse of that development
of vaulting known as fan tracery, must give the
palm to the windows. Without its stained
glass, King’s Chapel would be, like the Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Chapel at Ely, merely an interesting relic. As
it is, it is the rival of Fairford as the possessor
of the most complete set of windows of the Renaissance
period in England. Indeed, it would
be difficult to find their parallel anywhere.
Troyes is full of glass of the period, and, intrinsically,
the windows of one of its churches, St
Martin-ès-Vignes, are of equal interest, although
much later. For depth of colour and systematic
treatment these cannot be matched. They form
a connected exposition of the Gospel History,
proceeding by type and antitype from the conception
of the Blessed Virgin, through the life
of Our Lord and the apostolic history to the
Virgin’s death. In each window there is an
isolated figure or “messenger” between the
compartments, who bears a scroll with an appropriate
Latin text. Thus the windows embodied
the whole plan of salvation, showing the type,
the prophecy and the fulfilment. They culminate,
in the east window, in the central fact
of the Crucifixion. The west window, representing,
in accordance with general custom, the
Last Judgment, is modern (Clayton and Bell)
and is in very fair, although far from complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
harmony with the older glass. The merit of
the latter is not sustained all through, and the
windows on the south side, nearest the altar,
are coarsely treated in comparison with the
rest.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Mr C. E. Kempe is at present restoring
the windows dealing with the lives of Joachim,
Anna, and the Blessed Virgin, which suffered
from the enemies of so-called popery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">King’s College Chapel</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a thousand things to notice other
than the windows. I have mentioned the roof.
To understand its construction it is necessary to
pay a visit to the space between the roofs, where
the whole skeleton of the vaulting is to be seen
and its wonderful engineering appreciated. The
woodwork of the chapel is good, especially the
screen, a very fine and graceful example of that
Italian style which filtered into England through
the court of Francis I. It bears the love-knot
and twisted initials of Henry VIII. and Anne
Boleyn. The organ-case upon it belongs to
1606; the organ itself was built eighty years
later by Renatus Harris, but has been almost
entirely renewed since. The canopies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
choir-stalls are only a little older than the organ,
and look best at a distance. Then there is the
stone-carving in the antechapel, where the great
coats-of-arms and supporters, the rose and portcullis
of Henry VII. are repeated over and over again.
Lastly, in the series of chantries there are one or
two interesting brasses. Provost Hacombleyn’s
chantry, on the south side, commemorates the
provost who gave the beautiful lectern. He
died in 1528, and is buried here. The window
contains some good old glass; a portrait of Henry
VI. and two pictures of Our Lady and St
Nicholas of Myra, who are the patrons of the
chapel. In the centre of the chantry is the altar
tomb of Lord Blandford, only son of the great
Duke of Marlborough. He died here in 1703.</p>

<p>For two hundred years after the completion
of the chapel, the old northern court sufficed.
To the south of the chapel was the Provost’s
Lodge, which stood against the last bay, and,
with other college buildings, bordered the western
side of King’s Parade. In 1724 James Gibbs
began the present buildings with his beautiful
classical pile, which runs at right angles to the
chapel from near its south-west corner. Fellows’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Building is in Gibbs’ best manner. It is an extremely
plain building, with a rusticated basement
and a great central opening, which runs through
the first two stories and cuts into the third.
This may be thought an unnecessary intrusion,
but Gibbs had dispensed with an order throughout
the building, and some relief was imperative.
At any rate, the chief defect of this part of King’s
is its hideous chimney-stacks, which are only too
visible from the street.</p>

<p>Just a century later William Wilkins, who was
rearing marvellous edifices in the Gothic mode,
was let loose on King’s. He began with the
space opposite the chapel, and built the long row
which includes the Hall, Combination Room,
Library, Provost’s Lodge, and several sets of
rooms. This row begins at King’s Parade and
continues past the southern end of Gibbs’ Building
to within a short distance of the river—nearly
200 yards of supremely bad imitation Gothic.
In this range of buildings the Hall is the only
one which attracts much attention. It is large
and gloomy, with a gallery at each end, and an
elaborate plaster roof copied from Crosby Hall.
Sir Robert Walpole has the place of honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
above the high table, but there are very few
portraits, and the best is that of the late Henry
Bradshaw, University Librarian. Wilkins was
not satisfied with his undertaking. In 1828 he
proceeded to lay King’s open to the road. The
old Lodge was taken down, and a Gothic screen
thrown across from the New Building to the
south-east corner of the chapel. In the middle
of this is the gateway, famous under many nicknames.
To say that this fanciful structure is ugly
is not strictly true: it has a very distinguished
air about it, but it belongs decidedly to the era
of the Brighton Pavilion. It would be appropriate
in any country but England, and under
any other name but Gothic.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Scott added the small court known
as Chetwynd Court some forty years later. Its
eastern side follows King’s Parade in a line with
the end of Wilkins’ Building, and the face opposite
Free School Lane is adorned with a statue of
Henry VIII. Scott was too conservative and
kept to Wilkins’ style too much; the result is
not very successful. It was reserved for Mr
G. F. Bodley to build the beautiful river court,
which was completed on two sides in 1893.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Bodley’s Building is the architectural success of
Cambridge in the present century, and compares
very well with the same artist’s court at Magdalen
College, Oxford. Its style is late fifteenth
century: it consists of a ground-floor, two stories,
and a gabled attic. The corner-staircase and the
oriel of the south side are the chief features, for
the use of ornament is very sparing. The rose
and portcullis are introduced in places, and on
the western end, which drops into the river, are
carved the arms of Eton, King’s, and the tutelary
see of Lincoln.</p>

<p>The only other buildings which remain to be
mentioned are the last-century bridge, crossing
the river by a single span, and the choir-school,
a very handsome red-brick building in the
meadows west of the college. It deserves
notice as one of the very few really pretty
dwelling-houses round Cambridge, and as an
integral part of this noble and unique foundation.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In examining the motives which led to the
foundation of the various colleges, it is
interesting to observe how many of them were
suggested by similar and almost contemporary
foundations at Oxford. One may safely say
that the boundary-line between the middle ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and the new learning of the Renaissance was
crossed when William of Wykeham founded his
colleges of St Mary at Winchester and Oxford.
The political importance of William of Wykeham
and of his successors in the see of Winchester
made their work very conspicuous: two of them,
William of Waynflete and Richard Foxe, during
their tenure of the see, proved no less munificent
benefactors to Oxford than Wykeham had been.
The connection of the see of Winchester with
the Renaissance forced itself upon everybody’s
attention. Henry VI. was especially impressed
with it. Two bishops, Cardinal Beaufort and
Waynflete, played a prominent part at his court;
and it is to the latter that we doubtless owe
many hints for the foundation of King’s College.
However, at first, Henry VI. undertook the
work without any idea of uniting it with his
school at Eton. The college which he incorporated
in 1440 was a very humble affair. It
was restricted to a master and twelve scholars,
and the space chosen for it was small and
inconvenient. One of the main arteries of
Cambridge ran west of it; the whole site of the
present buildings was blocked up with houses;
the form of the court had to be adapted to its
narrow and cramped position. But, two years
later, the king’s plans matured. His foundation
of 1443 took a much larger form. It converted
King’s into a finishing-school, as it were, for his
Highness’ poor scholars of Eton. The dedication
of the college was changed. Hitherto, in
reference to the saint who presided over Henry’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
birthday, it had been called the King’s College
of St Nicholas. It now added St Mary, the
patroness of Eton, to its title. Thus it became
an exact counterpart of New College at Oxford.
Although Henry projected his buildings on a
far more magnificent scale than anything of
which Wykeham had dreamed, they had nevertheless
a certain resemblance to the Oxford
buildings. The plan includes a great tower and
a cloister west of it, such as were built at
Oxford. On the whole, the Founder must
have been thinking very closely of the colleges at
Winchester and Oxford, when he set his hand to
this splendid work. He made Waynflete, then
Warden of Winchester, Provost of Eton; and
Waynflete was the guiding spirit of the charter
by which the two communities were regulated.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The first provost of King’s came from the
opposite side of the street. His name was
William Millington, a fellow of Clare. We
are told that he was “set back for factious
favouring of Yorkshiremen.” At any rate,
Waynflete probably held the reins of both
foundations until his translation to Winchester,
which took place in 1447. Among the earliest
members of the college are one or two famous
names. Nicholas Close or Cloose, Bishop, first of
Carlisle and afterwards of Lichfield, was certainly
the overseer of the new chapel and perhaps its
architect. Thomas Rotherham, whose name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
so closely connected with the history of both
universities, was fellow of King’s, and gave
£140 to the chapel. His portrait is in the
Hall. Rather younger than these was Oliver
King, Bishop of Exeter, who afterwards distinguished
himself as Bishop of Bath and Wells.
The immense Perpendicular building of Bath
Abbey, which is due to his energy, is clearly
suggested by King’s Chapel, and reproduces many
of its details. John Chedworth, who is actually
the first provost of the new foundation, became
Bishop of Lincoln. His successor, Robert
Woodlark, was the founder of St Catharine’s
College. Another remarkable man of the end
of the fifteenth century was Nicholas West,
whose conduct as fellow was extremely indecorous.
His temper was naturally hasty, and,
when he was defeated in his candidature for a
proctorship, he made an attempt to set the
Provost’s Lodge on fire. Being baulked in this
endeavour, he ran off with the college spoons.
What action the college took is not recorded,
but we are informed that, after this ebullition of
temper, the quarrelsome fellow “became a new
man, D.D., and Bishop of Ely.” Not only
did he combine these three attributes, but, in
penitence for his wild design on the Provost’s
Lodge, built part of it. This was, of course, the
old Provost’s Lodge, south-east of the chapel.</p>

<p>Penitence, too, moved Henry VII. to finish
the chapel. As a member of the House of
Lancaster, his hereditary duty compelled him to
complete a work which even Edward IV. had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
found pleasure in favouring; while, as one of the
most extortionate and unjust kings who were
establishing their thrones about that time, his
conscience invited him to do something as an
<i lang="fr">amende honorable</i> for his misdeeds. King’s
College was already looked upon as a royal
legacy, and all the kings in their turn were well
disposed to it, but none promoted its welfare so
much as Henry VII., although his benefits were
chiefly posthumous. The provost to whom the
task fell of seeing that Henry’s bequests were
rightly fulfilled was Robert Hacombleyn, who
also had a reputation in his time as a commentator
on Aristotle. He lies buried in one of
the chantries south of the antechapel. He was
succeeded by Edward Fox, a native of Gloucestershire,
who was provost from 1528 to 1538.
Fox was a reformer, but it is said of him that he
had “prudence to avoid persecution.” He was
essentially a diplomatist, and held the Bishoprick
of Hereford during the last three years of his
provostship. He was busily engaged by Henry
VIII. in the matter of the divorce, and was sent
to Clement VII., Stephen Gardiner being his
companion. Afterwards he was ambassador to
France and Germany, and finally to the Schmalkaldic
League, when Henry, in his new-fangled
zeal for the Reformation, felt disposed to join
that body. At King’s he was followed by
George Day, who filled the office till 1548, and
held the see of Chichester with it.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. was a benefactor to King’s as
well as his father. He had other foundations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of his own to look after, however, and seems to
have regarded King’s as a good recruiting-ground
for Christ Church at Oxford—the college whose
glory really belongs to Wolsey. Among those
students of Eton and King’s whom we find thus
transferred is Robert Aldrich. Aldrich has not
much to do with King’s, but was Master, Fellow,
and finally Provost of Eton, and, after several
promotions, became Bishop of Carlisle, where
he remained until 1556, having successfully
weathered all the religious storms of his age.
Another very prominent member of the college
was Richard Cox, fellow in 1519. His strong
Lutheran opinions brought him into favour after
the divorce. He had been a Canon of Wolsey’s
original Cardinal College; in 1546 he was
made Dean of Christ Church. He was also
tutor to Edward VI. As a commissioner at
Oxford, he displayed great fury against the
papists, and, at Mary’s accession, not unnaturally
fled to Strasburg, where he had the congenial
society of Peter Martyr Vermigli. As
Bishop of Ely from 1559 to 1582, he had time
to modify his opinions, and it is recorded of him
that he hated puritans as much as papists. Queen
Elizabeth is said to have disliked him; he must
certainly have been very far from her mind.</p>

<p>To the names of these ecclesiastics we may
add that of Edward Hall, fellow of King’s, who
claimed direct descent from Albert II. of Austria,
and retired to Oxford. Richard Croke was a
learned Grecian of King’s, who went to Oxford
in order to be near Grocyn. He found patrons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in the munificent Warham and Sir Thomas
More, and was one of that <i lang="fr">coterie</i> which included
Colet and Erasmus. After he had travelled
abroad and lectured in Greek at Leipsic and
Louvain, he returned to England and became
Professor of Greek at Cambridge. This was in
1522. Later on, he was engaged in the divorce,
acting as Counsel to the Italian Universities,
and was made a Canon of Christ Church in
1532. He died in 1588 as Rector of Long
Buckby. Yet another of his class was Dr
Richard Mulcaster, who, at a somewhat later
period, transferred his talent and vast learning to
Oxford, and finally became famous as Master of
Merchant Taylors’ School.</p>

<p>Very seldom has royalty appeared at Cambridge
with such magnificence as on the occasion
of Elizabeth’s visit in 1564. Although her
actual abode was at Queens’ College, she spent
most of her time in King’s Chapel. The
provost at this time was Dr Philip Baker, who
had succeeded Dr Brassie in 1558. Elizabeth
was in her element: she was in a seat of learning,
and wanted to show herself as profound as any of
them. She rode to hear Te Deum and evensong
at King’s, dressed in the most gorgeous apparel
which even she could assume. At the door the
public orator praised her in long-winded Latin.
When his compliments tended to the fulsome,
she said “<i lang="la">Non est veritas</i>,” when they passed
probability, she said “<i lang="la">Utinam!</i>” Next day
was Sunday, and the politic Chancellor, Andrew
Perne of Peterhouse, who had burned corpses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
please her sister, made a Latin sermon before
her on the text “Let every soul be subject unto
the higher powers”—a command which he
himself had obeyed to the letter. The Queen
was highly pleased. Indeed, most of her visit
was occupied in hearing Latin disputations, and
nothing delighted her so much as the Latin of
Matthew Hutton, who laid the foundation of
his fortune by this means. On the Sunday,
after Dr Perne’s sermon, she again attended
King’s Chapel for evensong; and, in the evening,
having performed her religious duties so well,
the Virgin Queen once more returned to the
antechapel and witnessed the <cite>Aulularia</cite> of Plautus.
This must have vexed the good puritans of the
day! It is necessary to remark that the use of
college chapels for dramatic purposes was very
common, and nothing was thought of it. The
Commencements in Great St Mary’s were infinitely
more impious ceremonies. Even now,
when a mastership falls vacant, many college
chapels are used for the conclave of fellows, as
the chapel ensures more privacy than any other
part of the buildings.</p>

<p>Dr Philip Baker, who took part in these
solemn revels, was succeeded in 1569 by Dr
Roger Goade, a very serious divine. His son
was present at the Synod of Dort, a fact indicative
of the family’s opinions. King’s produced,
indeed, during the Tudor period, a large
number of grave and weighty persons. Sir John
Cheke had been provost during the reign of
Edward VI., and, together with the violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Protestant Walter Haddon, then fellow, and
afterwards Master of Trinity Hall, had done
important work as an ecclesiastical lawyer.
Then there was Giles Fletcher, brother of the
Bishop of London and uncle of the dramatist.
This remarkable man was Ambassador to the
Court of Muscovy in 1588, and concluded a
treaty of commerce with Ivan the Terrible.
His book “Of the Russe Commonwealthe”
has been an indispensable authority for all
subsequent historians of Russia. He was made
Treasurer of St Paul’s in 1597. A more
famous name still is that of Sir Francis Walsingham,
the great minister of Elizabeth. He was
a fellow commoner and left many valuable books
to the library. Dr Thomas Wylson, fellow of
the college, was also a well-known politician of
the same reign. He was tutor to Elizabeth’s
cousins, the young Brandons, Dukes of Suffolk,
and was ambassador to Holland in 1576. In
1577, he became Secretary of State, and, in
1579 Dean of Durham. It is said of him that
he was “master of every subject.” His correspondence
forms part of the Harleian MSS.</p>

<p>At Dr Goade’s death, in 1610, we approach
dangerous times. Dr Benjamin Whichcot, a
liberal puritan, became master in 1644. It is
generally supposed that his friendship with the
Earl of Manchester, who occupied Cambridge
for the Parliament, was the salvation of the
stained glass in the chapel. He was far too
learned a man to be bigoted, and was more of the
type of Milton than of the ordinary puritan divine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Dr Whichcot was a classic, and advised young
preachers to imitate Demosthenes and Cicero.
The gentle and metaphysical Cudworth was his
friend, and he died at Cudworth’s house in
1683, having been dispossessed of the provostship
since 1660. His memory was held long
afterwards in great esteem, and a selection from
his discourses was edited by the third Lord
Shaftesbury, the pupil of John Locke and
author of the <cite>Characteristics</cite>.</p>

<p>Of a very opposite type to Dr Whichcot was
the mathematician William Oughtred, author
of a book called <cite>Clavis Mathematica</cite>, and an
adept in archery. One writer says of him that
“Mathematics were not only recreation to him,
but Epicurism.” In spite of this devotion to
abstract sciences, he was an ardent royalist, and,
on hearing of the Restoration, died of joy.
Edmund Waller, the poet, was also at King’s
about the same time. We may imagine that
his ecstasy at the Restoration took a more substantial
form. Another type of don altogether
is shown us in Dr William Gage, who attended
chapel without a break for nine years, and read
fifteen chapters of Holy Scripture every day of
his life. This exemplary gentleman received
the living of St Anne, Blackfriars, where he
died in 1653.</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the list of provosts
becomes uninteresting, and the college history
becomes a very ordinary record. The privileges
of the foundation were strengthened with age.
It was very conservative and adhered very closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to the Founder’s plan, while other colleges were
opening their doors more widely and competition
was becoming a recognised part of university
life. It was autonomous: its members did not
proceed to public examinations in the schools, but
gained their degree by an examination of their
own. An Eton Foundation Scholarship was
the almost inevitable prelude to a scholarship
and finally a fellowship at King’s. Under such
circumstances the history of a college, however
sound its scholarship, is likely to be rather
quiet. In other respects, too, the existence of
King’s has been isolated. Its visitor is the
Bishop of Lincoln, and the college is a peculiar
in the diocese of Lincoln. It also enjoyed the
unique privilege of being exempt from proctorial
jurisdiction, and many a refugee from the
proctor’s mild justice has sought sanctuary in
King’s without fear of extradition treaties.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be supposed that this
noble college was at any time without its
worthies. Sir William Temple was educated
here. Although his name is doubtless an
ornament to the college, he must have been an
insufferable thorn in the side of his pastors and
masters, for he was the last man in the world
to have an ill conceit of himself. Two more
genial names appear later. In the absence of a
portrait of the Founder, a painting of Sir Robert
Walpole hangs at the end of the hall. He was
always a loving son of the college, and his
son, the even more famous Horace,* was here
as well. Charles Pratt, Earl Camden* and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Lord Chancellor of England, is another name
connected with the college; and Townshend,
a third statesman of the Georgian era, was
likewise brought up at Eton and King’s. To
turn aside from politics to the path of pure
learning, we find a very prodigy in the person
of Thomas Hyde, afterwards Archdeacon of
Gloucester. At the age of eighteen he performed
the almost incredible task, which till
then had been deemed impossible, of transcribing
the Persian Pentateuch out of its Hebrew
characters. It is scarcely surprising to find
that this precocious divine did not shine in
ordinary conversation. But his learning met
its recompense in a Canonry at Christ Church,
and Hebraists of his own age did not scruple to
reckon him equal as an Orientalist to Bochert
and Pococke.</p>

<p>The name of Sumner occurs twice in the list
of provosts, once in 1756 and again in 1797,
and, among others of the name, John Bird
Sumner,* the famous Archbishop of Canterbury,
was a King’s man. Earlier in the century lived
the painfully erudite William Coxe,* who, as
Archdeacon of Wiltshire, devoted his attention
to the Duke of Marlborough and the Hapsburg
family. His researches, although their method
is antiquated and their style is hopelessly dull,
are yet invaluable to the student, and his name is
not by any means the least among those of the
historians whom Cambridge has produced. But
to the majority of persons, the ecclesiastical celebrities
of King’s are overshadowed by the fame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of Charles Simeon, who was a fellow of the
college for considerably more than half a century
and, during that time, was a parish priest of the
town. He was the chief of those men who
roused the Church of England from her last-century
apathy and revived her ancient fervour.
Although his position was, owing to circumstances,
somewhat more restricted, he was to
Cambridge of his day what Cosin and Andrewes
had been to the Cambridge of theirs, and the
influence which he exercised from Cambridge
over the length and breadth of England was
almost unbounded. He is buried in the antechapel
of King’s beneath a stone on which
his initials are engraved, and there is a bust of
him in the University Library. The traditions
which he left to King’s have never been entirely
lost. The Church of England has had
few more devoted sons than the late George
Williams, who, as fellow of King’s, advocated
warmly the establishment of friendly relations
with the churches of the East. Older members
of the university still remember him as “Jerusalem”
Williams. And, although his life was
very retired and he was seldom absent for any
length of time from Cambridge, the late William
Ralph Churton, Canon of St Alban’s, was for
the last forty years of his life probably the most
active of all the English clergy in promoting
missionary work and extending the Church in
the colonies.</p>

<p>In mentioning these names, there are others
which have been necessarily omitted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
episcopal list of the college is a long one, and
includes, among many more prelates, the famous
names of Edmund Gheast, Bishop of Rochester
and Jewel’s successor at Salisbury; William
Wickham, Bishop of Lincoln and afterwards
the second Bishop of that name at Winchester;
and John Pearson, Bishop of Chester, who, first
a fellow here, was subsequently Master of
Trinity. Among noblemen, the great ambassador,
Stratford Canning, afterwards Lord
Stratford de Redcliffe (*&nbsp;Herkomer), occupies
a conspicuous place. Among ordinary laymen,
we find Roger Lupton, a Jacobean worthy,
founder of Sedbergh School; and, much later,
the poet, Thomas Lisle Bowles. In the
antechapel, a plain stone covers the remains
of Dr Richard Okes, provost from 1850 to
1889. And close by, under a similar stone, is
buried Henry Bradshaw (*&nbsp;Herkomer), University
Librarian, one of the finest scholars of the
century, who opened a new epoch in the history
of liturgical study. By the side of the south
door will be found a tablet in memory of the
late James Kenneth Stephen, an incomparable
orator, whose little volumes of verse proved him
the successor of Calverley among Cambridge
poets.</p>

<p>Within the last twenty years the college has
undergone a complete change. It is no longer
the exclusively Etonian college which it was.
Its scholarships, with the exception of a very
few, have been thrown open to all competitors,
and the large majority of undergraduates now at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
King’s have never been at Eton. Although,
from the standpoint of the lover of antiquity,
this departure from the Founder’s scheme is to
be seriously regretted, yet it cannot but be admitted
that, in the present century, the exclusive
scheme is impracticable, and newer methods have
to be followed. At all events, the plan works
very well, and in no generation is King’s likely
to lose its prestige, nor is that <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which
“Henry’s holy shade” seems to inspire, at all
likely to diminish.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Queens’ disputes with Jesus the honour of
being the most picturesque college in
Cambridge, and both are none the less picturesque
because they hide themselves away in a corner.
Dates are here a little difficult to determine, for
the gate-tower and the two brick courts from
King’s Lane to the river are strongly marked
with the stamp of medieval religion, and part of
the side towards Silver Street has an air of
undiluted antiquity which, in Cambridge, it is
refreshing to recognise. Still, supposing the
present buildings to have been begun about 1475,
the gate-tower cannot have been finished long
before 1500. This is clear if we compare it
with the towers at Jesus, Christ’s and St John’s,
all of which were built between 1497 and 1520,
Jesus being the earliest of all. This is not the
most conspicuous of them, but it is the boldest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and the arrangement of its corner turrets is
especially admirable. The court on which it
opens is small and simple, and its features are
very much the same as those which appear in the
oldest parts of St John’s. The Hall on the
west side is a restoration of the old Hall, which
was brought into agreement with last century
taste. It has a pleasant interior, and the woodwork
of the doors is good. On the north side
of the court is the curious sun-dial constructed by
Sir Isaac Newton; the turret on which it is
displayed is modern, but is an excellent ornament
to the court. Beneath it is a passage to the more
modern part of the college, east of which is
the old chapel, a Perpendicular building much
modernised by Essex in 1773.</p>

<p>Through the hall screens is the second court,
surrounded by low, tunnel-like cloisters with
plain, wide openings in each bay. This charming
court owes a great deal of its beauty to the
President’s Lodge, which occupies the whole of
the northern side. This quaint Elizabethan
building, with its high gables and bulging sides,
appears to advantage from every point, and the
oriels of its picture-gallery, so arranged that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
none being opposite another, the light is equally
distributed throughout, go to make an exquisite
picture which can hardly be excelled. On the
opposite side of the court, however, is the small
enclosure which, although known as Erasmus
Court, has very little to remind us of Erasmus.
Essex, who did so much harm in Cambridge,
rebuilt this corner of the college in his formal
manner about 1773. From the wooden bridge
at the end of the court, the damage done by this
addition to the river façade can be properly
estimated. The bridge itself dates from 1746,
and is said to have been designed by Newton on
a geometrical principle. It leads to the small
garden known as Erasmus’ Walk.</p>

<p>Returning to the eastern side of the college,
we find, north of the first court, a wing in line
with the gateway-tower, continuing the front of
the college along King’s Lane. This, which
was built about 1617, is not very remarkable,
and appears to have been intended for use rather
than ornament. Everything north of this is
modern. The northernmost range of chambers
was built by Mr W. M. Fawcett in 1886.
Although it is very good in its way, its juxtaposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to the new court of King’s is fatal to its
beauty. Here, too, Mr Bodley has been at work.
His new chapel, the most recent addition to the
buildings, is a pretty but not a very successful
piece of work. The interior is elaborately fitted
with a very complete set of stalls, and the organ-case
and reredos are very fair reproductions of
medieval painting. Mr Kempe’s windows and
the Flemish altar-piece deserve admiration, but
the south side of the building has been spoiled by
some very poor glass by Hardman, taken from
the old chapel. Queens’, on the whole, if we
except the President’s Lodge, depends on its
delightful general effect rather than on any very
special architectural merit.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In 1446 Andrew Doket, rector of St Botolph’s
Church, founded the College of St Bernard
for a president and four fellows. The site which
he chose for his foundation was east of the present
college, and comprehended an oblong strip of
ground running from what was then Milne Street
eastwards to Trumpington Street—in fact, part
of the site occupied by St Catharine’s. Doket,
who may be regarded as a second Edmund Gonville,
was first president of his college. However,
his original idea was small and its success
was scarcely inevitable. Henry VI. had just
founded his splendid college at the other end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Milne Street, and Doket conceived the happy
idea of inducing his queen to perpetuate her name
in the same way. Margaret of Anjou, who was
then, as Mr Atkinson points out, only fifteen
years old, showed great readiness in emulating
her husband. She consented in 1448 to refound
the college under the name of the Queen’s College
of St Margaret and St Bernard, and petitioned
Henry for a charter, which was readily granted.
The buildings were begun about this time on the
present site. The history of Queens’ College
thus offers an interesting parallel to that of the
similarly named college at Oxford. In both
cases the first idea is due to a clerk in holy orders,
who invites the reigning queen to occupy his
foundation. Margaret of Anjou has been since
looked upon as the chief foundress and benefactress
of the college. In gratitude, the society
adopted her coat-of-arms, and, although this was
superseded no less than three times by other
devices, it was adopted again in 1575, and is
now, with the addition of a bordure, the escutcheon
of the college. This magnificent piece of
heraldry, which attracts all eyes by its prominent
situation in the first court, recalls the claims of
the House of Anjou to European sovereignty.
The unfortunate history of Margaret’s father,
René of Provence, and her brother, the Duke
of Calabria, is the key to the shield. Its quarterings
include the arms of the kingdoms of Hungary,
the two Sicilies and Jerusalem in the upper half,
and, in the lower, those of the county of Anjou
and the Duchies of Bar and Lorraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The thirty-six years of Doket’s presidency
were interrupted by the Wars of the Roses,
which prevented the building from going on.
Doket, however, like so many heads of houses
in subsequent years, had an affection for his
college which hindered him from displaying any
political prejudice. In 1465, when Edward IV.
was firmly established on the English throne, he
applied for help to Queen Elizabeth Wydvil.
This lady owed her position at court to a situation
in Queen Margaret’s retinue, and she readily
accepted his offer. Just as her husband helped
on the building of the chapel of King’s, she extended
her aid to this other Lancastrian foundation,
and, under her protection, the work of
building proceeded. The only alterations due to
Yorkist patronage were a new coat-of-arms for
the college, and the change of the title from
Queen’s College in the singular to Queens’
College in the plural. The invocation of St
Margaret and St Bernard was retained without
alteration. The floriated cross of St Margaret
and St Bernard’s crosier are to be seen upon the
groined roof of the gateway, and, later on, when
Richard III. gave a new coat-of-arms to the
college in place of that granted by Edward IV.,
these emblems appear surmounted by the well-known
boar’s head.</p>

<p>Doket died in 1484, and was succeeded by
Thomas Wilkinson, whose rule lasted till 1505.
Then followed the three years during which
John Fisher, the celebrated Bishop of Rochester,
was president. This great man was one of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
band of scholars and divines who reformed the
state of learning in England. Queens’ College
probably owes to him the chief episode in its
history, the residence of Erasmus* within its
walls. It is improbable that Erasmus was at
Queens’ during Fisher’s presidency, as has
been so generally supposed. He was invited to
England by Henry VIII. soon after 1509, and
Fisher had given up the presidency in 1508. No
doubt, Fisher advised Erasmus, who, as Fuller
says, “might have <em>pickt</em> and <em>chose</em> what house he
pleased,” to the cloistral seclusion of Queens’;
and this is more likely than the somewhat far-fetched
alternative that he was “allured with
the situation of this Colledge so near the River,
as Rotterdam his native place to the Sea.” In
fact, Erasmus was simply allured to Cambridge
by the prospect of work, and does not seem to
have enjoyed life there at all. Three of his
letters are dated from Queens’ by name, and
they, as well as the rest written from no particular
address in Cambridge, prove that he regarded
his work there as a <i lang="fr">pis aller</i>. He complained of
his situation, his food and drink. Cambridge
beer encouraged the most painful ailments. He
wrote to a friend for a cask of Greek wine.
This rare beverage was finished all too soon;
when it was done, he kept the empty cask by him,
that he might at least refresh himself with the
smell. He was ill most of his time; he was
also continually in want of money. His professorships
were merely lectureships, and his pay
was probably small. Had it not been for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
patronage of Archbishop Warham and other
lovers of learning, he might have fallen into
serious straits. At no time did he realise the
value of money. Doubtless, he represented
himself as more unpleasantly situated than he
actually was. Like most delicate men, he was
very self-conscious, and expected an inordinate
amount of praise and flattery, which it is hardly
probable that he obtained at Cambridge. On a
previous visit to Oxford, he had been the centre
of a group of scholars; at Cambridge, he was
isolated from his old friends. We can therefore
hardly trust to his vivacious narrative for an
accurate account of his Cambridge life. But,
everything taken into consideration, he was
seriously discontented, and was glad to leave in
1514. His memory has been more than
ordinarily cherished in an University which
perhaps caressed him very little in his lifetime,
and his prestige has had a salutary influence on
Cambridge scholarship. When he came to
Cambridge, he found the old scholastic learning,
which he detested, still in vogue; when he left,
it was with the consciousness that he had inaugurated
a new era.</p>

<p>The next point in the history of Queens’ is
its acquisition under Dr William Mey of the
Carmelite house which lay between the college
and the present site of King’s. This house was
surrendered to the society in 1538, just before
the dissolution; but the interference of the
Crown delayed the completion of this transaction
till 1544. The ground which thus came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the possession of the president and fellows was
the foundation of all their future building. Dr
Mey was deprived at the accession of Queen
Mary, but was restored in 1559. He lived for
only a year afterwards. His next successor but
one was Dr William Chaderton, of whom Fuller
has preserved some curious anecdotes. He is
reported to have said one day in a wedding
sermon “That the choice of a wife is full of
hazard, not unlike as if one in a barrel full of
serpents should grope for one fish; if (saith he)
he ’scape harm of the snakes, and light on a fish,
he may be thought fortunate, for perhaps it may
be but an eel.” The ingenuity of the comparison
is very characteristic of our Elizabethan
universities, and is not a little in the manner of
Fuller himself. Fuller, indeed, received most
of what he would have called his “breeding”
at Queens’, and, here and at Sidney, he picked
up that curiously miscellaneous knowledge which
has made him one of our most entertaining prose
writers. He was essentially a Cambridge man,
and in all his books, however distant they are
from the purpose, we trace a certain appeal to
his university. He was not less positive as to
its antiquity than Dr Caius, although he went
less far back for its origin. His <cite>Church History</cite>
records the foundation of Cambridge as an
University by Sigebert, King of the East
Anglians, and in the sequel punctiliously refers
to the foundation of every college as an important
event in the history of the Church.
He did for Cambridge, in a more limited area,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
what Anthony Wood did for Oxford. His
politics were of an undecided kind, and he fell
into disfavour with both Parliamentarians and
Royalists, but he was, in fact, a moderate
partisan of the King. There is a story that he
was to have been made a bishop at the Restoration,
but he died before the offer was made.</p>

<p>John Davenant,* president from 1614 to
1622, was, as Bishop of Salisbury, one of that
galaxy of prelates which relieves the darkness
of the Civil Wars. He was the friend of
George Herbert, whose parsonage of Bemerton
was within three miles of Salisbury. He died
in 1641, before affairs had come to their final
climax. It is probable that he was guilty of some
of those numerous idolatries which Dowsing the
iconoclast destroyed on his visit to Cambridge.
Dowsing visited the college on St Stephen’s
Day, 1643, when he “beat down 110 superstitious
pictures besides Cherubim and Ingravings,”
and “digged up the steps for three
hours.” What Dowsing would say to the
internal fittings of the new chapel we have no
idea! After the storm had passed over and
the Restoration had given back quiet to the
college, its history languished: and, although
it has done well in the schools, it cannot be
said to have produced many men of great distinction.
In Isaac Milner (*&nbsp;Harlow), Dean
of Carlisle and President from 1788 to 1820,
it had a Church historian of some reputation.
Simon Patrick,* Bishop of Ely during the
reigns of William III. and Queen Anne, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a fellow here, and was one of the latest survivors
of the Laudian school. His account of the
opening of Edward the Confessor’s tomb is preserved
in the University Library in its original
manuscript. He was a great theologian and
something of a controversialist. Quite recently
the familiar figure of Dr Campion,* Vicar of St
Botolph’s and Honorary Canon of Ely, and
President of Queens’ for the last five years of
his life, has been removed from Cambridge.
His successor is Dr Herbert Ryle of King’s,
who holds with the office the Hulsean Professorship
of Divinity.</p>

<span class="smaller">ST CATHARINE’S COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">It has been said that the decorous quadrangle
of St Catharine’s gives the stranger the
impression of an old manor house rather than
of a college; and the trees which guard it on the
side of Trumpington Street are certainly a party
to the illusion. The western front of the
college, which occupies one side of King’s
Lane, has a more definitely scholastic air. For
the most part the buildings are uninteresting.
The tiny court at the north-west angle dates
from 1626; the rest of the college is the fruit
of a rebuilding which went on slowly from 1680
to 1755. Loggan, who published his illustrations
soon after the work was begun, figures,
with some optimism, an eastern façade with
a central cupola. This, however, was never
attempted. The chapel is an interesting piece
of Queen Anne architecture, dating from 1704;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and lately a fine organ by Norman &amp; Beard of
Norwich has been placed in it. In the present

Gothic style, but otherwise no radical alteration

<p class="dropcap">St Catharine’s is, in a certain sense,
the daughter of King’s, for its founder was
Robert Woodlark,* provost of the latter college.
The reason for its foundation is not very obvious:
it was probably merely a pious act on the part of
Woodlark, of whom we know very little beyond
this. The site on which it stood occupied the
greater part of that oblong space which still is
bounded on the north by King’s Lane and on
the south by Silver (then Small Bridges) Street.
Even now the space is somewhat cramped by
houses; then the college was thoroughly “town-bound,”
as Fuller puts it. However, although
one of the smallest colleges in Cambridge, it has
given, in comparison with its size, more famous
men to England than any college in either University.
These men are all clergy, and their
names are among the most reverend in Church
history. Seventy-four years after the foundation
of the college, Edwin Sandys* became master.
He is chiefly known as Archbishop of York and
as a translator of the Bible, and, while in exile
abroad during Mary’s reign, he cultivated friendly
relations with foreign Protestant churches. As
Master of St Catharine’s and Vice-Chancellor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he went through a critical experience, which is
narrated by Fuller. The Duke of Northumberland,
who was at Cambridge in the hope of
intercepting Mary’s progress from the Eastern
Counties to London, ordered Sandys to preach
before him at the University Church. Sandys
was a timid man and had very little faith in Lady
Jane Grey’s cause, so that the order caused him
some perplexity. He rose at a very early hour
next morning, and took the <i lang="la">sortes Biblicae</i> after
the approved manner of the sixteenth century.
The text at which his Bible opened was the
sixteenth and seventeenth verses of the first
chapter of Joshua, “All that thou commandest
us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest
us we will go. According as we hearkened
unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken
unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with
thee, as he was with Moses.” He preached
from this text in so politic a manner that no one
could find a handle of accusation against him.
The exacting Northumberland came back to
Cambridge after a short tour in Suffolk, well
aware that his enterprise was over, and with the
forlorn hope that, if he proclaimed Mary queen,
he might win his pardon. He invited Sandys to
join in the proclamation with him, but the Vice-Chancellor
refused with an answer that must have
been a very cold comfort to Northumberland.
The Duke, however, went through the business
mechanically at the old Market Cross, and was
arrested very soon afterwards at his lodgings in
King’s. Sandys escaped to the Netherlands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and returned when Elizabeth came to the
throne. He is buried at Southwell, where
the archbishops of York had one of their
palaces.</p>

<p>John Overall, Bishop of Lichfield, and afterwards
of Norwich, another of the translators of
the Bible, was master from 1598 to 1607. The
college leaned throughout its history to the
Puritanic side of the religious question, and
Richard Sibbes, master from 1626 to 1635, is
one of those strongly Puritan divines who had
the advantage of an University education. His
evangelical theology, rich in quaint phrase and
full of ingenious learning, is still popular with
serious readers, although his fame has been somewhat
overshadowed by the greater names of
Bunyan, Baxter, and John Owen. In spite of
this spiritual activity, it appears that the college
was about this time in a very bad and ruinous
state, and, on the side of Trumpington Street,
was excessively cramped for room. During the
mastership of John Hills, Sibbes’ predecessor,
John Gostlin, the eccentric master of Caius, gave
the Bull Inn, which was his personal property,
to the college, and thus the society was enabled
to enlarge its frontiers. Nevertheless, the commotions
of the Civil Wars delayed operations
until long after the Restoration, when Dr John
Eachard, master in 1675, carried out the longed-for
improvements. There is no college whose
external appearance belies a medieval foundation
more than St Catharine’s.</p>

<p>Side by side with Sibbes we may reckon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
famous Dissenting preacher, Edmund Calamy,
who was also a member of this college and was
connected with Sidney as well. But, after the
Restoration and Eachard’s improvements, St
Catharine’s settled down again to its episcopal
traditions. Sir William Dawes, Eachard’s
successor from 1697 to 1714, was a worthy
but in no way remarkable Archbishop of York.
During his time, however, the society received
a famous member in the militant Benjamin
Hoadly,* Bishop first of Bangor, then of
Hereford, then of Salisbury, and lastly of Winchester.
It is curious that Hoadly, the typical
Latitudinarian, as the ugly phrase goes, of
his age, and his opponent, the no less typical
High Churchman, William Law, were members
of the two Cambridge colleges which had
shown most activity on the Puritan side, St
Catharine’s and Emmanuel. Hoadly’s book,
<cite>On the Nature of the Kingdom and Church of
Christ</cite>, is his chief claim to celebrity, as the
doctrines which it advocated gave rise to the
Bangorian Controversy and were the cause of
many polemical treatises which have a distinct
literary rank.</p>

<p>Other members of St Catharine’s about the end
of the seventeenth century were Dr John Lightfoot,*
master from 1650 to 1675, illustrious as
an Orientalist; John Strype, the ecclesiastical
antiquarian, who died in 1737 at the advanced
age of ninety-four; and John Ray,* the naturalist,
who died in 1705. In 1704, during Dawes’
mastership, the chapel was consecrated by Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Simon Patrick of Ely, who was a member of
Queens’ College. In 1714, Dawes was succeeded
by Thomas Sherlock,* whose oratorical
powers gained him the Bishoprick of London.
His sermons, which are specimens of a cold and
stilted kind of eloquence, are read no longer,
but his name survives as that of one of the great
preachers of the last century. His successors
down to the end of the century have not much
interest outside the college. The long mastership
of Dr Procter* covers almost the first half
of the nineteenth century. During his time, the
versatile Dr Turton* was fellow of the college
and held various professorships. He became
Dean of Westminster and eventually Bishop of
Ely, where he continued till within comparatively
recent years. He is perhaps best remembered
as the composer of one of the most
beautiful hymn-tunes which we possess—the
tune called by him “Ely.” The college
produced yet another bishop in Dr Procter’s
successor, Henry Philpott, who was made
Bishop of Worcester in 1861. He was succeeded
by the present master, Dr Robinson.
The mastership of St Catharine’s is one of those
pleasant posts, which, like Pembroke College
at Oxford, have a canonry attached to them.
The canonry belonging to St Catharine’s is at
Norwich, the pleasantest of all English cathedral
cities, and, during the long vacation, the master
fulfils his term of residence in the Norwich close.
Among recent distinguished members of St
Catharine’s we may mention Dr George Forrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Browne, late Disney Professor of Archæology,
who succeeded Dean Gregory as Canon of St
Paul’s, and was, in 1897, translated from the
suffragan Bishoprick of Stepney to the revived
Bishoprick of Bristol.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Bishop Alcock’s gate-tower, a few
years earlier than those of Christ’s and St
John’s, and almost contemporary with that of
Queens’, forms a charming prelude to this
beautiful college. Its stepped battlements are
original, and its plan is more domestic than those
of the other towers, which have a very monastic
appearance. The founder’s coat-of-arms, the
three cocks which the college has ever since
borne as its cognisance, appear on various parts of
the tower and in the roof of the gateway; but the
statue of Bishop Alcock and a good deal of the
decoration are new.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The tower is the entrance
to the outer court of the college, whose ivy-grown
buildings date from 1641. They are very fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
late Gothic work and carefully follow Alcock’s
tower in their general lines; they are due to
Richard Sterne (master, 1633-1644 and again in
1660), but they were not actually finished until
the beginning of George the First’s reign. They
occupy three sides of the court; the western
side is open, affording a good view of the towers
in the centre of the town. From the opposite
side a low postern gateway (part of the original
work) leads into the inner court of the college,
round which the public buildings are situated.
The Hall is on the north side; opposite it is the
Master’s Lodge and the nave of the chapel.
The Library occupies the west side, and the
northern transept of the chapel the east side.
This was originally the cloister of the nunnery
which was superseded by the college. The
cloisters which exist are subsequent to the
founding of the college, and for some time were
shut in, like those at Wilton House. In the
last century, however, they were opened to the
court, and now they are simply of the ordinary
covered type, without any wall of partition. A
few years ago, while repairs were being carried
on in the eastern wall of these cloisters, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
north of the transept-end of the chapel, a
beautiful triple arch of the Early English
period was laid open, and may now be examined.
This was probably the entrance to the
nuns’ chapter-house. It is a very unique and
delicate piece of work, dating probably from
about 1240, and compares very well with the
excellent work of that period to be found in
Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>Part of the chapel dates from the foundation
of the nunnery, but a great deal of it is Early
English, and the whole building was remodelled
by Alcock on the collegiate principle. He seems
to have cut away the aisles of the convent church,
leaving only the north choir aisle; he left the
transepts unchanged, save for a set of Perpendicular
windows with scanty tracery, which are
repeated in the nave and choir. His east window
has been taken away and the Early English
triplet restored. He thus made an ordinary
monastic building into an aisleless cruciform
church, differing from a college chapel only in
that it retains a nave, in which respect it is
unique. He also added the Perpendicular upper
storey to the central tower, the lower half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which is Early English, and corresponds in its
interior arcading with the arches in the cloister.
The upper storey of this earlier tower had fallen
in 1297. On the whole, one can hardly give
unqualified praise to Alcock for his treatment of
the building, but he made it answer his purposes
very well. Moreover, he gave it some beautiful
stalls and a screen. Unfortunately, these ornaments
offended Georgian taste. The restoration
of the chapel in the last century was a wonderful
proceeding. The walls were daubed with yellow
relieved by a low black dado, the ceiling was
plastered, the best part of the woodwork was
removed to Landbeach Church, five miles on the
way to Ely, and the central lantern was closed
up, so that the fine arcade was completely hidden.
To-day, however, we are able to see the chapel
without these encumbrances, for the restoration,
begun in 1845 and continued to our own day,
has made it the most historical interior in
Cambridge. The south transept with its eastern
gallery is for the most part Norman of a very
simple order, coeval with the foundation of the
monastery. The central tower, the choir and
chancel are Early English, save for Alcock’s additions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
on the south side, and the remaining aisle,
which contains Decorated work. The arcaded
lancets on the north side of the chancel should be
noticed: this singularly graceful arrangement is
almost unique. There is, however, an example,
completer and perhaps finer, at Cherry Hinton,
within an hour’s walk of Cambridge. Another
specimen of local work is the double piscina,
whose splendid mouldings, crossing each other
in the head of the arch, and reminding one of
well-folded linen, are only to be found in three
or four churches in, or immediately round the
town. I have spoken of Alcock’s Perpendicular
work, which is of a kind more domestic than
ecclesiastical. The stalls and screen are rather
more than forty years old, but they show a taste
of a kind unusual at that time, and are much
improved by the dim light of the whole building.
This dimness is due to the stained glass, which
is all modern. The glass in the lancets is by
Hardman; it is not very good, but it is unobtrusive.
That in Alcock’s two choir windows
was put in rather earlier by the restorers of
1845-9; it is the great defect in their work.
But the eleven perpendicular windows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the antechapel, including the enormous south
window, have been filled with glass by Sir
Edward Burne-Jones and Mr William Morris;
and their magnificent, if somewhat secular, work,
serves to hide the shallowness and unoriginality
of the stonework. It is a pity that, in one or
two places, the colours already show signs of
decaying; but, on the whole, the two great
artists seldom collaborated to such purpose or
found such excellent material for their work.
The organ at the west end is new, and there is
perhaps too little space for it. The older organ,
a small instrument with a triptych front, is in
the choir aisle, and has an appearance strongly
suggestive of the bygone monasticism of the
place.</p>

<p>The rest of the Court, Hall, Library and
Master’s Lodge are much as the founder left
them, although their outer shell has been from
time to time considerably altered. The Hall,
with its dark lobby on the ground floor and its
staircase, is a fine room, occupying the position
of the convent refectory. There are some good
portraits here and in the Combination Room, including
one of Cranmer in the manner of Holbein.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The Hall was wainscoted early in the last century.
Since then and since the completion of the outer
court, the college has received no structural
additions to its main body.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Within the last
thirty years, however, the need for accommodation
has increased; and we owe to it, first, Messrs
Carpenter and Ingelow’s brick range of buildings
north of the college and their houses for married
tutors; and, secondly, the great building, also of
brick, which Waterhouse built about 1869 at the
end of the garden east of the chapel. His work
here is better than usual, and forms a picturesque
outpost to the colleges as one crosses the end of
Midsummer Common by the Newmarket Road.
The Jesus close, with its great palisade of trees
and its view of the boathouses on one side and
the venerable chapel tower on the other, almost
rivals the Backs in beauty.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">John Alcock, Bishop of Ely, whose
chantry chapel by Torregiano is one of the
chief glories of his diocesan cathedral, left a
more important monument to posterity in the
shape of Jesus College. In 1497 he obtained a
charter for his foundation, which succeeded a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
house of Benedictine nuns, existing under the
invocation of the Blessed Virgin and St Rhadegund.
This religious establishment had been
founded in 1133 by favour of Malcolm IV. of
Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, and its chief
benefactress was Constance of France, daughter
of Louis VI. and widow of King Stephen’s
son Eustace. Started under these auspices, it
became one of the most important conventual
houses in Cambridge, and received in its various
vicissitudes help from divers quarters. In 1297,
the chapel tower fell; there were fires in 1343
and 1376; in 1390, the buildings were seriously
injured by a storm. It is possible that the
morality of the house, which enjoyed great popularity,
grew lax, and that the change was necessary.
This was at all events the excuse for the
disestablishment of the convent. However, Mr
Clark, in his chapter on the college, proves with
great likelihood that these complaints were
merely superficial. The fact is that the demand
for education was increasing, and the supply was
furnished at the expense of the old monastic
houses. At its dissolution the revenue of the
nunnery was considerable. Alcock kept up the
traditions of the site by dedicating his college to
the Blessed Virgin, St John the evangelist and
St Rhadegund, but the title was soon exchanged
for the name of Jesus. By its foundation a
precedent was set for other colleges to follow.
After Jesus, other foundations were erected on
the site of some monastery or hospital; even
some of those existing, such as Queens’, bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
up monastic property and enriched themselves
with it.</p>

<p>Jesus College took for its first shield the
curious device of the five wounds of Christ.
But in 1575, it received its present coat-of-arms
in memory of its founder. The three cocks’
heads erased have always been a feature of the
college very much in evidence; they appear
constantly in the buildings, and, in the cloister
court, may still be seen the two cocks, one of
whom says to the other from the library wall
“ἐγὼ εὶμὶ ἀλεκτὼρ” (I am a cock), while the
other, from the hall, bears in his mouth a similar
scroll inscribed “οὓτως καί ἐγὼ” (And so am
I). Soon after Alcock’s time, the college
brought forth a fruit of the new learning in the
shape of Thomas Cranmer,* who was a fellow
here for some time. He lost his fellowship by
his marriage. He contracted an alliance with
the niece of the landlady of the Dolphin, an
inn close to what is now All Saints’ Passage,
and, having resigned his fellowship in consequence,
lived at the inn for some time. Cambridge
was a great university for reformers, and
at this time a number of men who afterwards
became distinguished for the novelty of their
opinions were in residence. The college has
honoured Cranmer’s memory, and one of its
most popular social clubs is named after him.
Readers of history know that Cranmer was no
less eminent as statesman and man of letters
than as reformer, and his college may be justly
proud of him. His portraits are interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The picture in the Hall is supposed to be a
copy by Reynolds from an older picture. In
the Combination Room is the portrait dated
1548, similar to the portrait of 1546 by Fliccius,
now in the National Portrait Gallery. And
in the Master’s Lodge is another portrait which
is probably a copy of the last. Both these latter
portraits have been attributed to Holbein.</p>

<p>The name of William Bancroft,* Archbishop
of Canterbury, brings us to the reign of James I.
That wise monarch, on his visit to the University,
professed a wish the justice of which
most of us have acknowledged, that, were he
at Cambridge, he would “pray at King’s, dine
at Trinity and sleep at Jesus.” The master
at this date was Dr John Duport. Jesus was,
of all colleges, most loyal to the Stewarts. Dr
William Beale, master in 1632, and removed
to St John’s in the next year, was a constant
royalist. His successor, Dr Richard Sterne,*
was entirely of the same opinion. He, with
Dr Beale and Dr Martin of Queens’, formed a
sort of syndicate for melting college plate and
sending it to the King; and was accordingly
arrested by Cromwell and imprisoned in the
Tower. His friends shared the same fate; but
Sterne was probably especially marked out for
this favour, as he had been Laud’s chaplain and
had attended him on the scaffold. After the
Restoration, he resumed his mastership, but he
was removed in the same year to higher honours.
In 1664 he was made Archbishop of York,
and died in 1683. His portrait in the Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
was presented by his nephew Laurence Sterne
(*&nbsp;Alan Ramsay) who was later on a pensioner
of Jesus. Laurence Sterne, who also took holy
orders, was a different type of man from his
uncle. The great sentimentalist is one of the
most distinguished <i lang="la">alumni</i> of Jesus, although he
did very little at college. As author of <cite>Tristram
Shandy</cite> and <cite>The Sentimental Journey</cite>, as fashionable
preacher and as wit, the eccentric Vicar of
Coxwold has achieved a reputation only a little
below that of Fielding, on the one hand, and
of Swift, on the other.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dr Sterne was succeeded
by Dr John Pearson, who, after shedding his
lustre on several colleges, became Master of
Trinity and finally Bishop of Chester. It is
fortunate for his various colleges that the honours
of this great theologian have been so divided.
About this time we come to the revered name
of Tobias Rustat (*&nbsp;Lely) Gentleman of the
Robes, who was a great benefactor to the college
and founded the Rustat scholarships. Even
to-day the Rustat scholars of Jesus wear a
peculiar gown of their own, differing slightly
from the gowns of the rest of the college.
Rustat is buried in the chapel, like Dr Ashton
at St John’s, and the college has reason to
remember his name with the gratitude which
Ashton’s liberality excited in Thomas Baker.
He may, indeed, be regarded almost as a second
founder of the college.</p>

<p>The masters of the eighteenth century were,
for the most part, stately and important men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
who received a great deal of promotion. Dr
Charles Ashton, of whom the college possesses
two portraits, was master for fifty-one years,
from 1701 to 1752. In his time there was
at Jesus a whilom famous scholar, Dr John
Jortin,* to whom we owe the very careful but
extremely dull life of Erasmus. He was a
popular divine, and combined the lucrative posts
of Archdeacon of London, Rector of St
Dunstan’s in the East, and Vicar of Kensington.
Dr Ashton was succeeded by Dr Philip
Yonge, who was master for six years, and was
then made Bishop of Bristol, being eventually
translated to Norwich in 1761. His portrait
in the Master’s Lodge is said to be by Reynolds.
His successor, Dr Lynford Caryl (*&nbsp;from a
portrait by Wright of Derby), is remarkable for
little save his picturesque name. He, in his
turn, give place to Richard Beadon,* who was
removed to Gloucester in 1789 and died as
Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1824.</p>

<p>When Dr William Pearce (*&nbsp;Beechey) was
Master—he was also Master of the Temple and
Dean of Ely—Samuel Taylor Coleridge (*&nbsp;from
Washington Allston) came into residence.
Coleridge was two years younger than Wordsworth,
and came up after the elder poet had
gone abroad to watch the French Revolution.
Less fortunate than Wordsworth, he left
Cambridge in 1794 without his degree, in
this anticipating Tennyson. Like most poets,
he formed few friendships while at Cambridge,
and took no considerable part in the academic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
life of his day. Milton, whose genius was
eminently academic, is the exception to this
rule. We find it difficult, on the other hand,
to look upon Coleridge as an University man,
and the same difficulty would occur with regard
to Wordsworth, were it not for his minute
account of his life at St John’s. Shelley, also,
who was twenty years younger than Coleridge,
took no degree at Oxford. Nevertheless, the
colleges of these unsatisfactory students have,
since their death, conspired to honour them, and
doubtless to many Jesus men Coleridge is their
<i lang="la">genius loci</i> very much as Shelley is to men at
University College.</p>

<p>Dr Clarke, Professor of Mineralogy (*&nbsp;Opie)
was a contemporary of Coleridge who preferred
to close his University life in the orthodox way.
He died in 1822, when Dr French* had
succeeded Dr Pearce in the mastership. The
days of ecclesiastical preferment ceased with
Dr Pearce, and his successors were content to
hold quiet country livings with their mastership.
This was the case with the late master, Dr
Corrie,* who divided his time between the
college and his pleasant rectory of Newton-in-the-Isle.
The last ten years of his rule were
remarkable for the supremacy of Jesus as head
of the river, when the college was full of oarsmen
like Mr Shafto and the late Mr Edward
Prest. It is matter of history how, when the
boat “went down” for the first time in ten years,
the Jesus men appeared on the river and the
towing-path in mourning. In 1885 Dr Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
(*&nbsp;Collier), the brother of a celebrated Oxford
man, the late Sir George Osborne Morgan,
became master, and under him the college, if
less successful on the river, has preserved its old
reputation. Among the modern sons of the
college we should remember Dr Wilkinson,*
the present Anglican Bishop in North and
Central Europe, originally Missionary Bishop
in Zululand, and the Rev. Osmond Fisher,*
Honorary Fellow, to whose antiquarian zeal the
college is indebted for the excavation of its
monastic remains.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Christ’s may be cited as a fair specimen
of the normal Cambridge college. Its
court and gate-tower have suffered considerably
since they were first built, having been recased
with stone in 1724. This pious work was
undertaken with funds supplied by Dr Thomas
Lynford, fellow of the college and Archdeacon
of Barnstaple, and is as well done as one can
expect of anything so radical. Two years later,
the west front of Pembroke was treated in the
same way, and the two may be cited together
as in some measure a vindication of the early
Georgian restorer. All that was done was to
make the face of the college flat and remove all
superficial irregularities, while the general lines
of the building were scrupulously maintained.
Dr Lynford is not responsible for the interior
of the court, which belongs to a later part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
century, and is due to Essex or one of his kind.
Originally, we may imagine a quadrangle of dark
red brick, very like the courts at St John’s
and Queens’. The gate-towers of all three
colleges are very similar; in that of Christ’s the
foundress’ statue is a modern addition. The
present chapel, north of the court, is substantially
the chapel of Lady Margaret Beaufort’s
foundation, and the small vestries are partly of
that date. As for the rest, it is very good work
of the middle of the last century imposed on
Italian Gothic, and the antechapel, with its
wooden columns, is admirable. Above the
altar is a good window by some German or
Flemish artist, not unlike the east window at
Peterhouse, and of much the same period. The
organ, in a gallery north of the sanctuary, is by
Father Smith, and the case is an excellent piece
of woodwork. At the west end is a curious portrait
of the foundress, and the chapel has a strong
historical interest as the burying-place of the Cambridge
Platonists, Cudworth, More, and Mede.</p>

<p>Between the Chapel and Hall stands the
Master’s Lodge, placed so as to communicate
with both. The Hall has been very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
restored, and is now a good Gothic hall, with
an oriel full of excellent portrait glass, representing
all the worthies of the college, from
the Lady Margaret down to Paley in his
archdeacon’s apron and Darwin in his doctor’s
gown. Beyond the hall, and facing westwards,
is the lovely building of 1642, which is usually
attributed to Inigo Jones. A range of older
buildings, constituting the south side of the court,
used to impede the full view of this beautiful
structure; but these were moved back early in
the century, and rebuilt in the hideous taste of
the time. However, we are the gainers by it.
Although the work at Clare is, as a whole, a
better specimen of the period, the Christ’s building
has the advantage of perfect uniformity, and
is an excellent example of the transition from
Renaissance Gothic to the style of which Wren
is the chief exponent. Its base is pierced by
a gateway leading into the famous garden, a
classic resort which is a very competent rival
of any garden at Oxford. Of the new buildings
at the north-eastern extremity of the college,
it is unnecessary to say anything; they are
moderate, but are hardly worth a detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
inspection. Their architect was Mr J. J.
Stevenson. Within the last three years Messrs
Bodley and Garner have been employed upon
the street front, and, needless to say, have
restored it with their usual conservative skill.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">For the beginnings of Christ’s College we
must go back to the year 1436. William
Bingham, Rector of St John Zachary in the city
of London, founded a small hostel or Grammar
College in connection with Clare, and placed it
on a site which is now occupied by the western
part of King’s College Chapel and a portion of
the great court of King’s. Four years later,
Henry VI.’s great experiment forced Bingham
to seek other quarters, which he eventually found
in Preachers’ Street, the thoroughfare leading
from the Barnwell Gate to the Dominican
Friary. Here he re-founded his college under
the picturesque name of God’s House, which it
had already borne in its former position. But,
like so many similar institutions, its revenues
languished. Bingham’s society was to consist of
a master with the title of Proctor, and of twenty-four
scholars. By the beginning of the sixteenth
century, the house maintained only four scholars
besides the Proctor. There is a story that the
great John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, was
bred at this hostel; and that his affection for it
was the cause which moved him to bring its
destitution to the notice of his friend, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Margaret Beaufort. It is, at all events, more
than certain that Fisher, who guided his patroness
in her pious resolves, called her attention to the
case, and so laid the foundation, as it were, of
Christ’s and St John’s. There is no satisfactory
evidence as to the time at which she conceived
the idea of founding St John’s. Probably, the
notion of a college had taken her fancy long before,
and it is not unlikely that the opportunity
of founding two colleges presented itself at one
time. At any rate, her first work was to re-establish
God’s House in 1505. The task of
converting St John’s Hospital into St John’s
College required several years of preliminaries
and formalities. But in God’s House she
had a college already to her hand. Henry VI.
had apparently promised Bingham some compensation
for the removal of the house, but the
greater work of founding King’s and the civil
troubles which soon engrossed the crown had
prevented him from fulfilling his promise. The
Lady Margaret, devoted to the memory of the
“royal saint,” endowed the society on the scale
approved by him, and provided funds for the
maintenance of a master, twelve fellows and
forty-seven scholars. And “from her singular
devotion to the name of Jesus Christ”—the
same motive which had prompted Alcock to
call his foundation Jesus College—she founded
the college under the invocation of Christ. We
have thus two colleges at Cambridge which recall
the popular devotion of the Name of Jesus, then
lately established and approved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>It may or may not be true that the foundress
had rooms reserved for her use in the Master’s
Lodge. The story seems contrary to the spirit
of that age or of any other, but a point may have
been stretched in her favour. The testimony for
this legend rests upon an anecdote told by Fuller.
“The Lady Margaret,” he says, “once …
came to Christ’s College to behold it when partly
built, and looking out of a window, saw the dean
call a faulty scholar to correction, to whom she
said ‘lente, lente,’ gently, gently, as accounting
it better to mitigate his punishment than to procure
his pardon; mercy and justice making the
best medley to offenders.” This is scarcely
sufficient authority for the tradition. There are
no less than four portraits of the Lady Margaret
in the college, the best of which is perhaps that
at the west end of the chapel, closely resembling
the picture in the hall at St John’s. The Combination
Room also contains a portrait of Bishop
Fisher, and both these pious friends of learning
are commemorated in the oriel of the Hall.
From the foundation of the college onwards, its
history has been peaceful and comparatively uneventful.
In its early years, it seems to have
anticipated the lodging-house system, for we are
told that some of the scholars were lodged in the
Brazen George, an inn opposite the college, and
that the doors of this hostelry were closed and
opened at the same time as the doors of the college.</p>

<p>Leland the antiquary and Hugh Latimer
were among the earlier members of the college.
But the history of Christ’s is centred in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
event, the seven years’ residence of John Milton,
who entered as a pensioner in 1625, and went
down with his Master’s degree in 1632. “John
Milton of London,” the entry runs in English
“son of John Milton, was initialed in the
elements of letters under Mr Gill, Master of St
Paul’s School; was admitted a lesser pensioner
Feb. 12th, 1624 [O.S.] under Mr Chappell,
and paid entrance fee 10s.” Mr Chappell, on
the authority of Dr Johnson, is said to have
flogged the poet. “There is reason to believe
that Milton was regarded in his college with
no great fondness. That he obtained no fellowship
is certain, but the unkindness with which
he was treated was not merely negative.”
Milton himself says enough to make the truth
of this statement at least doubtful; for his
language, ten years after his departure from
Cambridge, is not merely the language of a man
who had forgotten old grudges, but breathes a
lively affection for his college. The flogging
possibly took place; the University was then
nothing but a large public school, and each
college was a separate boarding-house. Milton,
when he went up, was just sixteen, and boys
of sixteen are not past flogging. If he went
down without a fellowship, he was surely, in
spite of that, a most promising student. His
Latin verses, which we still read as we read
Ovid and Propertius, are the finest poetry, and
not mere academical exercises; his skill in
Italian marks a degree of culture unknown even
in that Italianised age. In addition to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
scholarship, he possessed extraordinary personal
beauty, which gives him among poets something
of that eminence possessed by Raffaelle among
painters. We are told that he was called the
“Lady of the College.” And, while at Christ’s,
he wrote some of his most lasting works, including
the famous Hymn on the Nativity, which
was written in 1629. His verses on Hobson,
the University carrier, are well known, and
<cite>Lycidas</cite>, the elegy on his college friend, Edward
King, appeared at Cambridge in 1637. His
noble <cite>Verses at a Solemn Musick</cite>, containing
some of the finest and most imaginative lines in
English, belong to this early period. The master
under whom his residence took place was Dr
Thomas Bainbrigge, master from 1620 to 1645.
Cromwell had gone down from Sidney before
Milton came up to Christ’s, but he was still
in the neighbourhood of Cambridge. Milton’s
mulberry-tree, the Palladium of the college, may
or may not be Milton’s; but to believe the
tradition does no violence to our faith. The
memory of Milton had a more than usually
potent influence on another poet, Wordsworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">And this, from internal evidence, must have
been on a winter Sunday afternoon before
chapel! For the inebriated poet, always a sad
idler at Cambridge, had to run back “ostrich-like”
to chapel, where he arrived late and, full
of wine and Milton, swaggered up to his place
through “the inferior throng of plain Burghers.”
Here was a young gentleman who deserved
flogging!</p>

<p>But the presence of Milton must not allow us
to forget the band of contemplative scholars and
philosophers who, in his time, were the ruling
influence in the college, and now lie beneath the
chapel floor. The course of the reformed and
Puritan doctrines was largely determined by the
study of Platonic philosophy, just as the Aristotelian
system had allied itself to Catholic
theology. Platonism in Cambridge is the result
of two opposing forces: on the positive side, the
teaching of Erasmus; on the negative side, the
publication of Hobbes’ <cite>Leviathan</cite> in 1651.
This book received many reputations from
Cambridge men; two of the best known are the
work of Dr Bramhall of Sidney, Bishop of
Derry and afterwards Primate of Ireland, and of
Dr Cumberland of Magdalene, the painful Bishop
of Peterborough. But the most effective opposition
to Hobbes’ materialistic and mathematical science
came from Christ’s. The first of the Cambridge
Platonists was the meditative Mede, who died
in 1638. He was a fellow of the college in
Milton’s time, and spent his days in wandering
about the college backs and fields, absorbed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
mystical speculation, of which the eventual
outcome was his work on the Apocalypse. In
the evening, members of the college would resort
to his rooms, and he would ask them “<i lang="la">Quid
dubitas?</i> What doubts have you met in your
studies to-day?” and, having heard their answers,
would set their minds at rest and dismiss them
with prayer. But Mede was scarcely so remarkable
as Henry More, the author of the <cite>Mystery
of Godliness</cite> and other books, who devoted his
life at Cambridge to Platonic speculations, and
even extended his enquiries to the Neo-Platonic
writers and the Hebrew Cabala. Ralph Cudworth*
was three years his junior, and survived
him one year. This man, the greatest of the company,
was Master of Clare for some time, and,
in 1654, became Master of Christ’s, where he
remained, unmoved by the Restoration, till his
death in 1688. He was the most powerful of
Hobbes’ adversaries, and his <cite>True Intellectual
System of the Universe</cite>, published in 1678, is a
fairly convincing counterblast to the <cite>Leviathan</cite>.
However, Cudworth was rather a talented
pedant than a genius: he lessened the value of
his work by recondite allusions, and his critical
capacity was impaired by prejudice. But, in
that age of laborious theology, Cudworth’s book
deserves a position next to, although far below,
Leighton’s commentary on St Peter.</p>

<p>It is a somewhat melancholy fact that the
only other poet of whom Christ’s can boast
besides Milton is that master of tortured conceits,
Francis Quarles. Curiously enough, the portrait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
probably of Quarles, in the Combination Room,
which bears the motto “Nec ingratus nec inutilis
videar vixisse” was at one time supposed to be
that of Milton. But the college has had eminent
students in other departments. Dr Seth Ward,*
a little younger than Milton, is known as the
Bishop of Salisbury during the time of James II.
and the Revolution. In 1766, at the age of
twenty-three, William Paley* was elected a
fellow, and remained at Cambridge for ten years.
Paley’s early life is said to have been careless
and riotous. One morning, however, when lying
late in bed, a friend and boon-companion came
into his room, and treated him to what is sometimes
known as a “straight talk.” This admonition
awakened Paley’s conscience, and led in time
to the publication of the famous <cite>Evidences of
Christianity</cite> and to the Archdeaconry of Carlisle.
In all probability, no historical name is so
often on the undergraduate’s lips—not always
with blessings—as the name of this reclaimed
ne’er-do-weel. The <cite>Evidences</cite>, as is well known,
form part of the subjects for the Previous Examination
or Little-Go, and have in this capacity
given birth to an especial department of literature
in the shape of “Paley Sheets” and other
<i lang="fr">précis</i> of the heavy work. A less logical but
more human theologian was John Kaye,* master
from 1814 to 1830, and Bishop successively of
Bristol and Lincoln.</p>

<p>If, among statesmen, Christ’s can put forward
Lord Liverpool, famous for his interminable
ministry of more than twenty years, she has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in science, a son who is as famous in his branch
of study as Milton is in poetry. This was
Charles Robert Darwin (*&nbsp;Ouless) who came
up to Christ’s in the twenties with the intention
of taking holy orders. At Cambridge, however,
he found such opportunities for research that he
abandoned his design, and, at the recommendation
of Professor Henslow, who then held the
botanical chair, went out as naturalist to the
<i>Beagle</i>. This was the beginning of his scientific
career and of the revolution in biological science
which he effected. A tablet with his profile
in relief has been placed in the room occupied
by him, which is at present occupied by the
Norrisian Professor of Divinity, Dr Armitage
Robinson. To-day Christ’s not only claims as
its master Dr John Peile, the eminent classical
philologist, but the greatest of living scholars
who have devoted themselves to the study of
their own language—the editor of Langland and
Chaucer, Professor Skeat. And Cambridge men
will always remember with pleasure that Christ’s
was the college of the most pleasant of all
English versifiers, Charles Stuart Calverley (then
Blayds) who not only, by his light verses, added
to the gaiety of the nation, but, by his translation
of Theocritus, increased the range of English
poetry.</p>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">The first court of St John’s is almost as
composite as the Great Court of Trinity,
and the want of harmony between its parts is
rather painfully evident. The chapel, however,
is the only important extension of the original
plan as carried out by the Lady Margaret’s
executors, and the rest of the court survives
with certain changes. The gateway of the
college is one of the gate-towers so characteristic
of Cambridge, and is perhaps the most
beautiful of all. One of the great advantages
of St John’s is that it is built of red brick,
which, with time, has assumed a mellow
appearance; and thus it is, in certain respects,
one of the most picturesque colleges in the
University. The court and tower belong to
1520. Above the doorway, on the street
side, are the arms of Lady Margaret, supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
by the Beaufort antelopes, on a ground
in which the daisy, the foundress’ punning
emblem, occurs very lavishly. Although much
obliterated by time, this is still a very good
piece of heraldic sculpture. Other familiar
signs, which the least archæological undergraduate
learns to recognise, are the Tudor
rose and Beaufort portcullis. Above this
elaborate armorial display is a figure of St
John the Evangelist, added in 1662. Lady
Margaret’s statue is to be found in an ugly
niche over the entrance to the Hall screens;
it is in a pseudo-classical taste, and exaggerates
her pious emaciation of feature.</p>

<p>The Hall has been altered a good deal, but
it is an interesting apartment, long, dark and
narrow, like a conventual refectory. Its darkness
is due partly to the fine wainscoting,
which is of the linen-pattern, partly to the
deep colours of the heraldic windows, whose
interest is historical rather than artistic. The
fresco of the upper part is not very successful.
At the end of the hall is a curious portrait of
the foundress, in the manner of Lucas van Heere,
which bears comparison with her picture in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Christ’s. She is supported by full-length
portraits of Archbishop Williams and Ralph
Hare, benefactors to the college. One of
the most interesting pictures is the well-known
portrait of Wordsworth by Pickersgill; and
the modern portrait of Professor Palmer in full
Arab attire (John Collier) usually attracts
comment. St John’s Hall is not rich in
portraits, a deficiency which is remedied by
the collection at the Lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>No other college unfolds its architectural history
in so leisurely a way as St John’s. We pass
from the first to the second court, from 1520 to
1598. In the latter year, Ralph Symons,
who was supplying Dr Nevile at Trinity with
designs, began to build this beautiful quadrangle.
Mary Cavendish, Countess of Shrewsbury, is
the benefactress to whom the college is indebted,
and her statue occupies the niche over
the gate-tower between this and the third court.
Some will have it that this is the best piece
of contemporary building in Cambridge, and
it certainly has a peculiar charm, due to its
studious, sober air. The sole ornaments of
this gabled enclosure are the two charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
oriels in the centre of the north and south
side, and the gate-tower, which is not unlike
the similar tower at Hampton Court. Along
the first floor of the north side of the court
runs the long gallery, once a part of the
Master’s Lodge, but now the Combination
Room. It is the best Combination Room
in Oxford or Cambridge. At present it is
divided into two parts by a wainscoting, but
this hinders the general effect very little. The
plastered ceiling is very richly ornamented with
pendants and formal arabesques, and has much
in common with other splendid ceilings of the
same date. When the doors of the inner room
and of the library beyond are both open, an
incomparable vista is obtained, and the two
apartments are transformed into a single
gallery.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a landing, approached
from the second court by a picturesque oak
staircase, separates the Combination Room
from the Library, which occupies the whole
north side of the somewhat gloomy third court.
Over the door are the arms of Lord Keeper
Williams, impaled on the coat of his see of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Lincoln. This famous prelate contributed
entirely to its erection, and his initials and
the date 1624 are lettered in white stone
outside the western oriel. It was completed
in 1628, and remains unaltered, a very charming
specimen of Italian Gothic. Its interior,
with its high timber roof and fine bookcases,
is the <i lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of a library interior. There
are two stories: the upper contains the valuable
collection of ancient books and the bequests of
various benefactors such as Matthew Prior,
the lower is devoted to more modern books.
The rest of the court was not built till 1669,
and is therefore a little later than the buildings
at Clare, with which it has some affinity.
Its western gateway and cloister form an excellent
termination to the long perspective of
St John’s from the outer street. And the
view of the court and library from the river
is too well known to need remark.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the third court we are on modern
ground. Mr Rickman’s Bridge of Sighs is
the beginning of the long cloister which forms
one side of the New Court. The view from
the bridge, including Ralph Symons’ lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Kitchen Bridge and the sweep of the Cam
as it rounds the corner opposite Trinity Library,
is more beautiful than the bridge itself; but the
bridge, in its turn, is the most meritorious part
of this immense court, in itself a college. It
was built from Mr Rickman’s designs between
1827 and 1831, and is a proof of the common
criticism that its architect’s theory was vastly
superior to his practice. The extremely ornate
cloister, with its traceried openings and vast
central gateway, has no <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i>, and the
rest of the court is merely a huge barrack with
a pretentious central staircase. From certain
parts of the “Backs,” when the shallow detail
is sufficiently screened by trees, it forms an
effective background to the prospect; but, near
at hand, its effect is bare and ponderous.</p>

<p>All modern changes in the original buildings
are to be found in the first court. In the
original plan the Master’s Lodge adjoined the
Hall on the south, and the Chapel on the
north, and filled up an angle between them.
The court existed thus till 1774, when Essex
came here, as to other colleges, and faced the
south side with the present front, which might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
be creditable in Harley Street or Cavendish
Square, but is merely ugly in a college.
Further, in the early sixties, the College resolved
to build a new chapel. The old one,
whose site is marked by the slabs in the grass
south of the existing chapel, was never a very
remarkable building and was quite inadequate.
So, in 1863, Sir Gilbert Scott came, built the
chapel, and remodelled the court. The Master’s
Lodge was taken down, the Hall was lengthened
by two bays, one of which is a new oriel, the
staircase and lobby leading to the Combination
Room were made, and the new Lodge was
built on the ground north of the Library. Scott’s
immense chapel is, no doubt, too large for its
purpose, and the heavy tower is painfully out
of proportion to the rest, especially when seen
from the west end. The style is typical of
the architect’s genius for imitation. He knew
two buildings by heart, the Sainte Chapelle
and the Angel Choir at Lincoln, and he put
them into all his designs with a fatal formality.
The exterior of St John’s Chapel is somewhat
tedious, and every detail is just a little too
prominent—the statues in the buttresses, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
example. On the whole, Scott’s chapel at
Exeter College, Oxford, is much better. But
inside the building is very striking, especially
the transeptal antechapel, which, in spite of
the bad glass at the north end, recalls the antechapel
of New College at Oxford. The tower
inside is open to the first storey, and in the
higher window there are good fragments of
old glass. The glass in the inner chapel and
in the great west window is by Clayton and
Bell. Lord Powis, High Steward of the University
at the time, gave the windows in the
apse, and the rest are in memory of friends
and benefactors of the college. The chapel
was consecrated in 1869 by Dr Harold Browne,
then Bishop of Ely. Some of the old stalls
from the original chapel, with their miserere
seats, have been kept; and the fine Early
English piscina which belonged to the chapel
of St John’s Hospital has been incorporated
in the arcading of the chancel. It belongs to
a local class which includes the piscina at Jesus
Chapel and the piscinae in the transepts at
Histon, three miles away. Another relic is
the altar tomb of Hugh Ashton, Archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of York, who was one of the foundress’
executors and died in 1522. The upper
portion of the monument is canopied and
richly coloured; the lower part is open and
contains the “cadaver,” which was fashionable
with ecclesiastics of the day. Ashton’s
rebus, an ash growing out of a tun, appears
in various parts of the base and canopy. In
the antechapel also are Baily’s statue of Dr
Wood, Master of St John’s and Dean of
Ely, and the old altar-piece by Raphael Mengs.
Other objects of interest are the paintings on
the roof, a procession of illustrious Churchmen
and Churchwomen of every age leading up to
the figure of Our Lord in glory, which occupies
the centre panel of the roof in the apse; the fine
organ by Messrs Hill; and the marbles in the
chancel. The chapel is 172 feet long and 63
feet high to the inner roof. The pitch of the
outer roof is 80 feet, and the tower rises to 140
feet.</p>

<p>The Master’s Lodge is a comfortable building,
and contains a number of pictures, including two
portraits of Charles I. and Henrietta Maria by
Vandyck, and a large portrait of Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Prior (Rigaud) in his official robes. Since
then, the only addition of structural importance
to this interesting college has been the wing
known as the Chapel Court, which runs at right
angles to the main building opposite the west
door of the chapel. This was added in 1884,
by Mr F. C. Penrose, and is of red brick with
white stone dressings and with a louvre in the
centre. The college grounds have been laid out
from time to time, and, with their winding walks
and beautiful Fellow’s Garden, are the most
interesting and romantic of all the gardens near
the river.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In founding St John’s College, Lady Margaret
Beaufort followed the precedent of Bishop
Alcock. It is curious to observe how the most
fervent Catholics of the Renaissance era subordinated
monasticism to the revived learning
and disestablished religious houses on merely
nominal pretexts. The close likeness between
the document which explains the dissolution
of St Rhadegund’s Nunnery and that which
excused the abolition of St John’s Hospital
detracts from the value of the charges they
contain and leads us to believe that they are
merely repetitions of a recognised form. St John’s
Hospital was a small religious alms-house which
had been founded in 1135 by one Henry Frost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and was under the management of Black Canons.
It had a certain importance as being the first site
of Hugh de Balsham’s collegiate scheme. He
grafted his scholars upon the monastic stock, but
his plan was anything but a success, and he removed
his <i lang="fr">protégés</i> to Peterhouse. The hospital
was not a very flourishing affair, and, whether
the charges of immorality were true or not, there
was sufficient excuse for its dissolution in the
fact that in 1509 it contained only two brethren.
The Lady Margaret, in that same year, the year
of her own and her son’s death, obtained leave
to suppress it and found a college on its site. She
had been prompted to this work by her confessor
and faithful adviser, John Fisher, Bishop of
Rochester, himself a man of great distinction in
the University, a friend of learned men and a
patron of study. And, although the college is
very justly proud of its royal foundress and shares
her coat-of-arms with Christ’s College, the active
part of the work was carried out by Fisher as
her executor. The Charter of foundation was
granted by Henry VIII. in 1511, and Fisher
himself consecrated the Chapel in 1516. It
follows that, although Fisher was a member of
Queens’ College, his name is connected almost
entirely with St John’s. This close relation of
one man to two colleges is clearly manifested by
the likeness which those parts of St John’s built
by Fisher’s instrumentality bear to parts of
Queens’ College.</p>

<p>St John’s College was the last and greatest of
the Lady Margaret’s works. When we think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of the benefits which she conferred on Oxford
and Cambridge, her noble provisions for the
theological schools of both Universities, and her
two foundations in Cambridge, we can only echo
the words of the funeral sermon preached by
Fisher in her honour, that the “students of both
Universities, to whom she was as a mother …
for her death had cause of weeping.” Very
few colleges have so tender an attachment to a
founder’s memory as that which St John’s has
for Lady Margaret’s; there are very few colleges
which are so haunted, as it were, by their founder’s
spirit. And the history of St John’s is a record
worthy of the Lady Margaret. Although, in after
years, it was a little overshadowed by the greater
glory of Trinity, it kept the second place against
all competitors, and its roll of illustrious names is
almost as crowded as that of Trinity itself.</p>

<p>The first master was Robert Shorton, who
continued in the college for five years, after
which time he became Master of Pembroke.
His portrait is to be found among the great
collection in the Master’s Lodge. The early
masters of the college followed one another
very rapidly; in fact, between 1511 and 1612
we find no less than seventeen names, an almost
unique instance of quick succession. Under
the Tudors, too, the college history is not profoundly
interesting. It is evident that, during
the reign of Edward VI., the fashionable
Genevan doctrines became popular in the
college. Thomas Leaver, master in 1551,
was a supporter of the new religion, and was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of course, ejected by Mary. However, with
Elizabeth’s reign the Puritan spirit returned in
double force. The two Pilkingtons, who occupied
the mastership in succession, introduced
their Genevan and German friends to the
Universities, and sought to model University
life upon the system followed by the foreign
Calvinists. It is worthy of remark that while,
during this period, Trinity was producing
Bacon, St John’s had already produced the great
Burghley, the first of her illustrious sons, and
perhaps the most illustrious of them all. St
John’s became for many years the hereditary
college of the Cecil family. The connection
between the college and both branches of that
great house is still kept up in the prize exercise
known as the “Burghley Verses,” one copy of
which is sent annually to Hatfield and another
to Burghley.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The accession of noble families to the college
and the consequent growth of court influence
probably weaned the foundation from its Puritanism.
Dr Whitaker* was the last of the
Genevan School. He was a married man,
and kept up an establishment for his wife in the
town. The college prospered exceedingly in
his time. These were the days of Dr Nevile
of Trinity, when Cambridge received her most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
beautiful buildings. Whitaker’s successor, Dr
Richard Clayton, who ruled from 1595 to
1612, had the felicity of seeing the second
court built under his auspices. Among the
fellows at this time were Richard Neile,* and
Thomas Morton,* who, as Archbishop of York
and Bishop of Durham, were great benefactors
to the college. And, with the reign of James I.,
the college began to distinguish itself, like St
John the Baptist’s College at Oxford, as a
Royalist institution. Thomas Wentworth, Earl
of Strafford,* the great Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, and Lucius Cary, Viscount Falkland,*
the blameless hero of the Cavalier party, are
the celebrities of the first half of the seventeenth
century. In William Beale,* master from 1633
to 1644, the King had an enthusiastic supporter.
In his time the college plate was melted down,
and many valuable pieces were sacrificed. The
plate was sent across country to Charles, who
was then at York or Nottingham, and the
passage was so well contrived that the convoy
escaped the ambush set by Oliver Cromwell. Dr
Beale was less happy, for Cromwell, in a fury,
marched upon Cambridge, and took him prisoner
while he was at his prayers in chapel. In
company with Dr Martin of Queens’ and Dr
Sterne of Jesus, he was taken off to London
and imprisoned in the Tower. He died in
1646. During the Commonwealth, the college
was ruled by Dr Arrowsmith and Dr Tuckney,
but at the Restoration the famous divine, Dr
Peter Gunning,* became master, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
previously Master of Corpus. He was made
Bishop of Ely in 1670, when he was succeeded
by Francis Turner.* In course of time, Turner
succeeded Gunning at Ely. With these prelates
we may couple the name of Edward Stillingfleet,*
the well-known Bishop of Worcester.</p>

<p>Thomas Baker,* the historian of St John’s
College, deserves honourable mention. The
treasure which Oxford possesses in Anthony
Wood, St John’s finds in Baker, whose accurate
history, quaintly and piously written, is a mine
of information on the subject of Cambridge life
during the seventeenth century. Baker was a
Royalist of considerable bias and a non-juror,
in consequence of which he lost his fellowship.
He was careful to describe himself on his title-page
as <i lang="la">Socius Ejectus</i>, and gloried in the distinction.
He died in 1740 at the age of eighty-four.
His devotion to his college, not only
to the foundation itself, but to its remotest
benefactors, is a quality unique even in those
days of fidelity to a principle. He set the
college an example by which it has profited.
To-day no college in Cambridge is in possession
of such an amount of printed historical matter.
Professor Mayor’s monumental edition of Baker
and of the life of Ambrose Bonwicke stand at
the head of the list. Mr Torry’s extremely
full and interesting notes on the roll of Founders
and Benefactors are invaluable, while Mr Scott’s
“Notes from the College Records,” which are
published from time to time in the college
magazine, form a supplement and commentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to Baker’s history. Ambrose Bonwicke, whose
life is at once an exhortation to the painful
student and a faithful picture of social life at
Cambridge, entered St John’s in 1710, the last
year of the mastership of Turner’s successor,
Humphrey Gower. Bonwicke died early, so
that the story of his labours and exertions,
phenomenal in a mere boy and impossible in
our own age, has a vivid pathos. From the
light which he throws upon college life of his
time, we are led to imagine that, however
luxurious it may have been then, it would now
be insupportable, if conducted in the same way.
But then the prime object of university life was
study, and athletics and dinner-parties were
considered foreign to the main purpose.</p>

<p>Matthew Prior,* although a man of a different
type from Baker, felt something of the same attachment
for St John’s. He was sent to Cambridge
by his patron, the Earl of Dorset, and
in course of time obtained a fellowship. With
considerable forethought, he refused to give up
his fellowship when promoted to high offices of
state, and consequently, after his imprisonment
by the Whigs in 1715 and the loss of all his
fortune, he managed to keep body and soul together
at Cambridge. The enormous portrait of
him by Rigaud, which is now in the Master’s
Lodge, displays him in his robes as an ambassador,
and is one of the most striking pictures in the
college. He left a very beautiful collection of
books to the library, among which may be
mentioned a splendid folio edition of Ronsard’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
poems. His poetry is essentially of the outer
world and not of Cambridge, but its culture and
the academic flavour which is apparent in the
most frivolous pieces bear clear testimony to the
influence of the University on this light-hearted
scholar. A very opposite type of scholarship—the
laborious and critical—is represented by
Richard Bentley,* who was a member of the
society at the same time with Matthew Prior,
and rose to further fame as Master of Trinity. In
this period, too, Divinity was well represented. To
say nothing of Bishops Gunning and Turner, great
names in the history of theology, three masters of
the college held, with their mastership, the Lady
Margaret Professorship of Divinity within a very
short time of each other. These were Dr Humphrey
Gower,* master in 1679, Dr Robert
Jenkin,* in 1711, and Dr Newcome in 1735.</p>

<p>Since the arrest of Dr Beale, St John’s has
enjoyed a very quiet history. In the eighteenth
century, it produced the regulation number of
noblemen and paid its full contribution to the
cabinets of the period. Towards the end of
the century, we remark the name of the eccentric
Samuel Parr, whose portrait hangs in
the Combination Room, and of Herbert Marsh
(*&nbsp;Ponsford), the controversialist and Bishop of
Peterborough, to whom Professor Mayor has
devoted a large space in his edition of Baker’s
History. At the same time, we notice with
interest that William Wilberforce (*&nbsp;G. Richmond)
and Thomas Clarkson (*&nbsp;Room) were
at St John’s together, and, while there, doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
cultivated the humanitarianism which is their
common title to fame. Clarkson was a native
of Cambridgeshire, having been born at Wisbech,
where his father was master of the Grammar
School, in 1760. But, in 1787, St John’s
received her most distinguished poet, William
Wordsworth (*&nbsp;Pickersgill). He himself, in
lines which are at once oddly prosaic and incomparably
sublime, has described his impressions
during his residence at Cambridge. These,
however, are the sole tie which binds him to
the place; for his retiring nature led him very
little into society, and his emotions and impressions
were all highly subjective. He has told
us where his rooms were, but, owing to constant
alterations, their exact position has been somewhat
disputed. They are at present turned into
one of the kitchen store-rooms. Some people,
by a curious misreading of the text, have imagined
that he could look into Trinity antechapel from
his rooms and see Newton’s statue. As a matter
of fact, he merely says that he could see the antechapel,
and this feat is easily performed from any
back-window on the south side of the first court.
Like most highly imaginative poets, and unlike
the materialistic Matthew Prior, Wordsworth
was a dilatory student, and he deserted Cambridge
in 1791 for the wilder excitement of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>It is probable that no one has derived so much
earthly benefit from an early death as Henry
Kirke White, who entered the college in 1804,
died in 1806, and has ever since been reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
as one of its chief ornaments. He is also the
only member of the University who has a public
monument in Cambridge. At the age of nineteen
he was a very promising mathematician, and was
patronised by Southey as a rising poet. The
small collection of poems and letters which constitute
his “remains” show great religious fervour
and some metrical skill, but their imagination is
defective and morbid. His death excited great
compassion, and his name still lives, in England
and America, as that of a precocious genius. It
is not unlikely that the greater name of Henry
Martyn* is less widely known. This distinguished
scholar and Orientalist became a
fellow in 1802, but left Cambridge three years
later to become a missionary. His life, short
although it is, is a splendid record of devoted
piety and self-denial. He went through dangers
and privations in parts of the East which were
then totally unknown to Europeans, and died in
the prosecution of his labours. He may be
regarded as the forerunner of a great band of
Cambridge missionaries, the earliest name in a
kalendar which includes Ragland, Mackenzie,
Patteson and Smythies.</p>

<p>During the Napoleonic wars, Cambridge was
possessed with a great martial ardour, and
among the most active promoters of the volunteer
movement of those days was Lord Temple,*
who occupied rooms in the first court, looking
out on the street. Later on, this nobleman was
better known as Lord Palmerston. One of those
who enrolled themselves under his guidance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that eccentric gentleman, Patrick Brontë, subsequently
Vicar of Haworth in Yorkshire and
father of a family whose tragic history is well
known to every student of English literature.
With the name of Palmerston, we touch modern
times and come to the days of the scientific and
mathematical pre-eminence of the college. An
extraordinary number of great men have come
from St John’s during the present reign. Among
scholars, Benjamin Hall Kennedy (*&nbsp;Ouless)
has the first place. He was, before his election to
the Greek professorship, Head Master of Shrewsbury,
a school which has always been closely
connected with St John’s. The most distinguished
historian was the late Charles Merivale,
Dean of Ely, whose <cite>History of the Romans
under the Empire</cite> is a monument of Cambridge
scholarship. The names of scientists are legion,
but one must not fail to mention John Couch
Adams,* who was a Johnian and a fellow of
the college. The late James Joseph Sylvester
(*&nbsp;Emslie), although his genius was devoted to
Oxford, is another man of world-wide fame
whom St John’s owns. The college supplied
another distinguished professor to Oxford in
the person of Charles Pritchard, the well-known
Savilian professor. It is also necessary to mention
the name of Edward Henry Palmer, Lord
Almoner’s Reader in Arabic, who, with one
possible exception, was the best Oriental scholar
of the century. More intimately related to the
college were the two Babingtons, Churchill
and Charles Cardale,* who spent their lives at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Cambridge and filled University professorships.
It would be invidious to select names of living
members of the college, but Professor Mayor,
(*&nbsp;Herkomer) the editor of Juvenal, and the present
Bishop of Gloucester, Dr Ellicott, have their position
securely assured. Recently, too, the death
of the Hon. Charles Pelham Villiers, the “father
of the House of Commons,” robbed the college
of an old member and constant friend. The
modern history of St John’s is essentially progressive,
and, under Dr Bateson and the present
master, Dr Taylor, the college has been worked
on broad and liberal lines. Its yearly position
in the schools testifies that it has in no way
declined from its original purpose, and is still
that nursery of learning which its foundress
intended it to be. And, in connection with
the modern development of the college, it is
impossible not to say something of the College
Mission. St John’s was the first Cambridge
college which thought of extending its energies
for the benefit of the poor in large towns, and
its mission in a crowded part of Walworth was
the example which moved other colleges and
schools to do something of the same kind. The
result is shown in the beautiful church and group
of buildings which form the nucleus of the parish.
No more effectual realisation than this could be
found of the ideal of the foundress and Bishop
Fisher, that their work should not merely be
accomplished for its own benefit, but that in
time to come, what they had done for their
scholars, their scholars should do for others.</p>

<h2 id="XV">XV<br />
<span class="smaller">MAGDALENE COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Magdalene is changed very little since
the days of Samuel Pepys. Its first court
has been refaced with new-looking red brick,
but the interior, with its luxuriant covering of
ivy, is time-worn and venerable. There is,
however, not much of any importance. The
Hall is, perhaps, the best which is to be found
among the smaller colleges, and the spacious
double staircase which leads from it to the Combination
Room, is a feature of which any college
might justly be proud. “Although the staircase,
as it exists, is the work of restorers, the
detail of the woodwork is excellent, and was
doubtless suggested by the fine Renaissance carving
at Audley End.” The Chapel, north of the
court, was restored in 1847, and retains some of
the ancient features, including the roof. There
is some modern stained glass, not very good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Beyond the Hall, in the same position as the
building at Christ’s (with which it may be
compared), is the famous Pepysian Library, a
charming building in the very latest style of
Renaissance Gothic. Its general effect is quite
equal to the earlier work at Christ’s, and is very
superior to that of the river front at Clare, with
which it is almost contemporary. The spandrils
of the arches in the basement are very profusely
decorated with fantastic patterns, and similar
ornaments appear in the space between the
library windows and the heavy cornice below
them. The Ionic pilasters of the central compartment
show traces of the Palladian influence
which just then found its way everywhere; and
it is a fortunate circumstance that the architect
had enough feeling for his style not to multiply
them. As it is, they add to the charm of the
building, and bring its central division into a
prominence which is demanded by the two very
plain wings with their chimneyed gables and
rusticated angles. The Master’s Lodge (1835)
is north of the college, and is supposed to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
on one of the escarpments of the ancient
Camboritum—that is, if the Castle-Hill is
Camboritum. Otherwise, it is a simple Gothic
building, rather better than most houses of the
time, but with no obtrusive features.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">We have seen that Jesus and St John’s
Colleges were founded by means of the
dissolution of monastic houses. Magdalene,
founded thirty-one years after St John’s, was
merely the final step in the secularisation of a
religious house. In 1428 Henry VI. granted
the site of the present college to the monks of
Crowland, who wished to found a hostel at
Cambridge for the use of their scholars at that
University. The Abbeys of Ely, Ramsey and
Walden joined with Crowland in the work, and
contributed to the building. In the latter half
of the century this theological college, as we
should call it, received substantial aid from
Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, whose
favours were continued in 1519 by his son
Edward. In recognition of the benefactions
of Duke Henry, the hostel took its title of
Buckingham College. The foundation seems
to have departed gradually from its original
purpose, for laymen were admitted to it before
the dissolution. However, it was only natural
that, when Crowland surrendered to the King,
its dependent house should surrender also. The
crown resumed the property in December, 1539.
Henry VIII. granted the messuages of Buckingham
College to Thomas, Lord Audley of
Walden, who also became possessed of Walden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Abbey. In all probability, the original connection
between the abbey and the college
induced him to refound the institution on a new
plan. He reconstituted it in 1542 under the
name of the College of St Mary Magdalene.
Since his day, through all the vicissitudes of his
family, Magdalene College has remained under
the protection and patronage of the owner of
Audley End, a stately and beautiful appendage
to the noblest country house in England. His
work was carried on by his successors. At his
death he left a daughter, the lady whose
magnificent portrait by Lucas van Heere hangs
in the great hall at Audley End. She married
the Duke of Norfolk, who, in 1564, being at
Cambridge with Queen Elizabeth, generously
promised the college an annuity of £40 until
they had finished the “quadrant of their college,”
and further endowed the society, which
was become much impoverished, with landed
property. Norfolk’s liberality was supplemented
by the contributions of the Lord Chief Justice
Sir Christopher Wray,* who had been one of
the lay students of Buckingham College.</p>

<p>The college was never large, and its history
is scanty. Its first master of any importance
was Dr Thomas Nevile, who reigned from 1582
to 1593, and then removed to Trinity. His
fame belongs to the history of the latter college.
In the great concussion of the seventeenth
century, Magdalene adhered, as was natural,
to the royalist side, and its master, Dr Rainbow,*
was rewarded after the Restoration with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Bishoprick of Carlisle. Nicholas Ferrar,* the
famous superior of the community at Little
Gidding, and the friend of Crashaw and
Herbert, was a member of this college as well
as of Clare, and his portrait, with that of his
mother, is preserved in the Master’s Lodge.
This saintly man, like Herbert, was happy in
dying before the troubles of his party began.
But one naturally connects Magdalene less
with Ferrar than with an individual of a very
different order. Mr Samuel Pepys was entered
at Trinity in 1650, but, for some reason,
preferred Magdalene. By no means a scholar,
he enjoyed the social advantages of the
University, and in after years remembered the
grateful flavour of Goody Mulliner’s stewed
prunes, which he used to buy “over against the
college.” His eventual generosity to Magdalene
was something of an accident. During the
closing years of his life, the college was raising
the exquisite eastern building. Pepys was then
casting about for a suitable destination for his
library, and there is no doubt that the singularly
admirable qualities of the new building, as well as
his own prepossession for Magdalene, aided his
decision. By his will, he bequeathed his library
to his nephew, Mr Jackson (another Magdalene
man), as his trustee, and provided that, at the
death of this gentleman, it should pass to
Magdalene, and, by an express stipulation, be
housed in the New Building “and any part
thereof, at my nephew’s selection.” The document
contained certain reservations in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Trinity. Its whole wording shows an amusing
caution. After a preamble, in which he expresses
his apprehension of the danger which
might befall the books at the hands of an
incompetent heir, he proceeds to leave them,
at his nephew’s death, to one of the two
Universities, but to Cambridge rather than to
Oxford. Then he states his preference for a
private to a public library, and confines the
private libraries to Trinity and Magdalene.
Finally, he prefers Magdalene to Trinity, but
provides that, in case of specified losses, the
books are forfeit to the latter college. In this
respect, he imitates Parker’s bequest to Corpus.
“And that for a yet further security herein,
the sᵈ two colleges of Trinity and Magdalen
have a reciprocall check upon one another; and
that college, wᶜʰ shall be in present possession
of the sᵈ Library, be subject to an annual
visitation from the other, and to the forfeiture
thereof, to the like possession and use of the
other, upon conviction of any breach of their
sᵈ covenants.”</p>

<p>John Jackson died in 1724, and the precious
legacy passed to Magdalene. Its value is incontestable,
and no treasure is to this day more
jealously guarded. The inscription “Bibliotheca
Pepysiana,” and Pepys’ motto, “Mens cujusque
is est quisque,” were put up on the building
after the arrival of the books. The value of the
bequest was more fully illustrated when, in the
present century, Lord Braybrooke, a Magdalene
man himself and visitor of the college, translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Pepys’ cypher diary and gave that unvarnished
picture of contemporary manners to the world,
opening thereby a most fruitful mine of research,
as well as discovering a hidden classic. Dr
Peter Peckard,* master from 1781 to 1797,
enriched the library with his own collection.
He was Dean of Peterborough. The see of
Peterborough, at the beginning of the same
century, was held by a Magdalene man, Dr
Richard Cumberland, whose very exhaustive
treatise on Jewish Weights and Measures, as
well as his polemical essay in answer to Hobbes,
are still remembered, although seldom read.
The name of Daniel Waterland,* master from
1713 to 1746, is of greater fame in the history
of controversial theology.</p>

<p>The present century, from 1813 to the present
day, is covered by the long masterships
of an uncle and a nephew. The first of these
was the Hon. George Neville Grenville, Dean
of Windsor (*&nbsp;Pickersgill); the second is the
present master, the Hon. Latimer Neville, who
has ruled his college for forty-five years. The
Nevilles of Audley End are descendants of the
founder in the female line. The first Lord
Braybrooke, the editor of Pepys’ Diary, was a
Neville of Billingsbear in Essex, and succeeded
the last Lord Howard de Walden, of the family
of Griffin, on the death of that nobleman without
male issue. During the century, Magdalene has
had some reputation as a fashionable college;
but the amusing American critic, Mr Everett,
spoke of it somewhat unjustly when he said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
“it is a favourite home for young men who are
of the opinion, either from conjecture or experience,
that other colleges are too strict for them.”
It has, like other small colleges, produced an
excellent percentage of scholars and learned men.
Our opinions as to the literary merits of Charles
Kingsley (*&nbsp;Lowes Dickinson) may be divided,
but there can be no question as to his abiding
influence on English letters. He is equally
well known as parish priest, cathedral dignitary,
novelist and poet, and Professor of Modern
History. The roll of living members includes
the name of Professor Alfred Newton (*&nbsp;Lowes
Dickinson), and the genial and kindly influence
of the late Mr Frank Pattrick (*&nbsp;Dickinson),
Tutor and President of the college, is gratefully
remembered by the latest and youngest of those
who have pursued their studies at Magdalene.</p>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">The Great Court of Trinity represents the
earlier foundations of King’s Hall and
Michael House. Of these, the latter was the
older, and its buildings occupied a position nearly
corresponding to the south-western angle of the
present court. It may safely be supposed that,
up to the last half of the eighteenth century,
some remains of the original building were
allowed to exist, although Dr Nevile had
probably faced them in accordance with his
general design. In 1771, however, James Essex
made a radical alteration in this corner, and the
only part which was thought worthy of preservation
was the kitchen. This quaint room, entered
by a passage from the hall-screens, still survives,
and may be regarded as the nucleus of the
modern Trinity. The next relic of importance
is the King’s Tower, which now blocks up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
west end of the Chapel, and occupies the centre
of the north side of the court. It stood originally
a little south-east of its present site, and opened
at the junction of two lanes, one of which ran
diagonally from the old church of All Saints’
to the Cam, while the other, coming from the
present Trinity Lane, was bounded on the west
by the small court of Michael House. Now, of
course, the tower, removed and rebuilt, shows
very little trace of antiquity, and the oldest part
of it is the statue of Edward III., which stands
above the gateway, and bears the inscription
“Tertius Edwardus fama super aethera notus.”
This may be ascribed to the reign of Edward IV.
Later on, in the reign of Henry VII., the
foundation of the great gateway was laid, and a
chapel for the scholars of King’s Hall was built.</p>

<p class="caption">Trinity College</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after King’s Hall had received its
new eastern gateway, which implies a considerable
extension of the college, Henry VIII. dissolved
the lesser foundations and founded Trinity as we
know it. Henry’s chief wish was to provide
a sufficient chapel. It was not, however, until
Mary’s reign that any activity was shown in this
work. Mary furthered her father’s project, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
allowed the builders to use the ruins of Cambridge
Castle as their quarry. The work was finished
by Elizabeth. Trinity Chapel is an excellent
example of late Perpendicular work. As Gothic
work, it is stiff and debased, and forms a striking
contrast to the elegance of the Renaissance Hall.
Its exterior has been very little altered. Internally,
however, it belongs to a much later period.
The west window was filled up by Nevile; the
east window is obscured by a huge baldachino
of the last century. During Bentley’s mastership,
Father Smith built the present organ, one
of the largest in England; and the whole chapel
was refitted to suit the capacities of this instrument.
Opinions may differ about the beauty of
the heavy wooden screen in an uncompromisingly
classical taste which supports the organ and
divides the chapel from the antechapel; but it is
unquestionably a very appropriate addition to a
stately, if ugly, interior. The carving of the
stalls is by Grinling Gibbons. Alterations did
not stop here. The present century has made
the building what it is. Within the last thirty
years the roof and walls have been highly
decorated in accordance with the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
chapel, and the result is very imposing. Mr
Henry Holiday’s stained glass, which represents
the saints and worthies of the Church from the
earliest period, is good, although its merits are
a little various. The western windows near the
organ, devoted to members of Trinity, are the
best. In the antechapel the glass is very bad
indeed. Otherwise, this part of the building is
not much altered, and its panelling of dark oak
makes it one of the most impressive sights in
either university. This is much increased by the
fine statues. Of these, that of Newton, by
Roubiliac, was given in 1755 by the master,
Dr Smith. The rest are more modern. Bacon’s
statue, by Weekes, was given by Dr Whewell;
Barrow’s by the late Lord Lansdowne. The
statues of Macaulay and Whewell are both by
Woolner.</p>

<p>These various buildings and others which
had grown about them were gathered together
in the reign of James I., and the result is the
Great Court, one of the largest and certainly
without exception the most beautiful of quadrangles
in the world. Trinity owes a great debt
to Thomas Nevile, who was master from 1593 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
1615. To bring his buildings into a systematic
form, he took down King Edward III.’s tower
and rebuilt it west of the chapel. He added
the upper storey to the great gateway, and placed
the statue of Henry VIII. in a niche outside,
while on the side towards the court he set up
in corresponding niches statues of James I.,
Prince Charles, and the Princess Elizabeth.
On the south side he built the Queen’s tower,
which contains the figure of Queen Mary, and is
exactly opposite King Edward’s tower. Finally,
to the west he built the Hall, north of the old
hall of Michael House, and, further north still,
the Master’s Lodge. His architect was that
admirable genius, Ralph Symons. Although the
Great Court has been partly faced with stucco
and, in certain places, refronted, its beauty is
indestructible. The sets of rooms which join
the towers and other buildings together, have
their height in very just proportion to the size
of the quadrangle. What the effect would
be, were they higher than they are, may be
seen by comparing the Jacobean buildings with
Essex’s classical addition near the kitchen, and
the modern Gothic buildings between the Chapel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and Lodge. The beauty of the court finds its
central point, perhaps, in Nevile’s exquisite
fountain, built in 1602, which has all the best
attributes of English Renaissance work. It
may be compared with the gateway just outside
the south-western corner of the court.</p>

<p>The Hall, with its light oriels and graceful
louvre, was finished in 1604. Its interior is,
perhaps, a little over-decorated, but possesses a
certain splendour which finds no parallel in
England. The western gallery, covered with
rich carving and highly gilded, may be compared
with the similar galleries at Audley End
and other contemporary houses. The portraits
are interesting, although of no great excellence
as a whole. Newton, Bacon, and Barrow
occupy the north end, and other celebrities,
such as Dryden, Cowley and Pearson, are to
be found on the side walls above the panelling.
Sir Joshua Reynolds’ charming portrait of the
little Duke of Gloucester hangs close to the
western oriel, and near it is Mr Watts’ portrait
of Tennyson. Other modern portraits are those
of Thackeray (Lockhart Bogle), Dr Thompson
(Herkomer), Dr Lightfoot (Richmond), and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of living celebrities, Professor Michael Foster
(Herkomer) and Dr Henry Jackson (C. W.
Furse).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the Hall, Nevile built the court,
which bears his name, and, for a certain beauty
of its own, is not far behind the Great Court.
Ralph Symons was again his architect. This
building consisted of two wings, shorter than
at present, at right angles to the Hall, and
built above a cloister. These splendid arcades
are the very crown of Renaissance work in
Cambridge; their cloistered ground-floor recalls
Bologna or Padua rather than the court
of an English university; but their upper stories
are thoroughly English work. Nevile’s Court
did not assume its present secluded, aristocratic
appearance until considerably more than a
hundred years later. Isaac Barrow, one of
the many great Masters of Trinity, began the
library in 1675, with Sir Christopher Wren
as his architect. The court was completed
by the generous addition of two compartments
to the original arcades, which was paid for by
some of the fellows. Wren’s Library is so
prominent that its incongruity with the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the court is not at once obvious, but there
can be no doubt that it is seen at its best on
the river side. Its front towards the court
is adorned with a bas-relief which represents
the dedication of the Septuagint to Ptolemy
Philadelphus. On the roof are four statues
of learned nymphs by Gabriel Cibber, which
are chiefly remarkable for the part they played
in one of Byron’s most senseless freaks. The
interior of the Library is matchless for its
magnificent simplicity. It is a pity that the
arbiters of taste in the last century should
have allowed Cipriani to design the window
at the south end, but this is the sole fault.
The numerous busts (some by Roubiliac), the
carvings on the bookcases (Grinling Gibbons)
and Thorwaldsen’s statue of Byron are remarkable.</p>

<p>Wren is also supposed to have harmonised
the side of the Hall which stands opposite,
with his Library. The present meaningless
alcoves and the balustrade which have superseded
Nevile’s work on this side, are probably
by Essex, who was brought in to prop up the
Hall and build the Combination Room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Kitchen Offices in 1771. A little while
before Wren began working at Trinity, John
Hacket, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry,
founded Bishop’s Hostel, the small building
south of the Great Court, and close to the
Trinity Lane entrance. These buildings
(1670) are now somewhat overlapped by
the modern buildings of Garret Hostel, which
are also of red brick. Garret Hostel is, however,
a much older component of Trinity, and
the modern buildings are simply a revival.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century Bentley
effected his famous alterations in the Lodge
and Chapel, and Essex made the additional
changes to which I have referred. No actual
addition was made to the college until, in
1823, William Wilkins began his court in
the revived Gothic taste, adjoining Nevile’s
Court on the south. George IV. proved a
benefactor to the extent of £1000, and the
official name of the new building is for this
reason King’s Court. It was finished about
six years later. Cambridge, as we have seen,
has a long tale to tell of Georgian Gothic,
and the New Court of Trinity is a very typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
example of that period. It nevertheless is a
far more pleasant building than Wilkins’ court
at Corpus or Rickman’s at St John’s, although
there is not much to praise in it. To a much
better period of modern Gothic belong Mr
Beresford Hope’s improvements in the Lodge
and the Master’s Courts, usually known as
Whewell’s Court (and by more familiar names),
which are opposite the great gate of Trinity,
and are one of the thoroughfares between Trinity
Street and Sidney Street. Dr Whewell built
this court at his own expense, with Salvin as
his architect. Outside, it is gloomy but imposing.
The darkness of its interior was till quite
recently almost to be felt; but now (1898)
they are being refaced, and the depressing rooms
are being made into comfortable and picturesque
habitations.</p>

<p>The grounds of Trinity are spacious and
pleasant, and the famous lime-walk is one of
the wonders of Cambridge. When Dr Nevile
built his court, he filled up a branch of the
Cam which ran northwards from Garret Hostel
Bridge and rejoined the main stream at the
north-west corner of the present Library. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
bridge which connects the lime-walk with the
new court was built by Essex, and is his best
work in Cambridge, if that is any praise.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The royal foundation of Trinity College is,
as a matter of fact, one of the youngest
colleges in Cambridge. At the same time, it
is to Cambridge what Christ Church is to
Oxford, and, more than that, its name, to a
great number of people, is almost synonymous
with Cambridge. Henry VIII., the most
learned of our English sovereigns, was naturally
a great patron of learning. In 1546, the year
in which, with his characteristic want of scruple,
he took upon himself the credit of founding
Wolsey’s great college at Oxford, he also
founded Trinity at Cambridge. His material
was ready to hand, for the small colleges and
hostels which filled up the space between the
present Trinity Street and the river provided
scanty room for their members, and needed amalgamation.
Trinity, in fact, as it now exists, is
composed of a number of separate foundations,
the principal of which were Michael House,
founded in 1324, and King’s Hall, founded by
Edward III. in 1337. These two colleges had
gradually absorbed many of the smaller hostels.
The founder of Michael House was Hervé de
Staunton, treasurer to King Edward II. In
spite of its limited situation, it had a certain
amount of prestige, and one of its last masters
was John Fisher, afterwards President of Queens’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and Bishop of Rochester. It used the church
of St Michael as its chapel. King’s Hall, on
the other hand, had, by the time of Henry
VIII., extended its boundaries and built its
own chapel. It had grown out of a corporation
of scholars, which had found a patron in
Edward II., and had been presented by Edward
III., in 1336, with a piece of ground belonging
to one Robert of Crowland—which may point
to a connection between the foundation and
Crowland Abbey, the great centre of English
learning. A regular charter was granted in
1337. The accounts of the institution remain,
and point to a style of living which would not
be very highly accounted of now, but was
positively luxurious for medieval Cambridge.
The scholars attended chapel at St Mary’s by
the Market and All Saints’ in the Jewry, until,
in Edward IV.’s reign, they obtained leave to
found a chapel for themselves. King’s Hall
naturally became the nucleus of Henry’s college,
and the lesser buildings found their centre in its
court, enlarged and beautified. John Redman,
the last master of King’s Hall, became the first
master of Trinity College.</p>

<p>Under the charter of 1546, Henry VIII.
founded Trinity College for a master and sixty
fellows and scholars. The full title was
“Trinity College within the Town and University
of Cambridge of King Henry the
Eighth’s foundation.” Michael House, dedicated
primarily to St Michael the Archangel,
had been founded under the secondary invocations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, St
Mary, and All Saints; and it is probable that
the first of these suggested the name under
which the college has become so famous.
Trinity College is the most distinguished fruit
of that revived learning which paved the way
for and accompanied the Reformation: from the
very beginning its tendencies were liberal and
progressive; every genius which it nourished was
eminently constructive. The names of its three
greatest <i lang="la">alumni</i>, Newton, Bacon, and Barrow,
form, so to speak, the three fountain-heads of
organized philosophical thought in England; and
there are a hundred less monumental names
which are sufficient guarantee of the intellectual
supremacy of Trinity over her sisters. The
history of the college divides itself naturally
into periods. The first is a period of consolidation,
extending from 1546 to 1593. During
this time, the college suffered the ordinary
vicissitudes of the Reformation. Its chapel,
which had been projected by Henry VIII., was
begun by Mary and finished, probably out of a
sense of duty, by Elizabeth. In 1553, William
Bill, the second master, who had been appointed
under Edward VI., had to retire in favour of a
Catholic master, John Christopherson, but was
of course restored at the accession of Elizabeth.
He was succeeded in 1561 by Robert Beaumont,
who presented to the Master’s Lodge a portrait
of the founder by Lucas van Heere, one of the
most excellent portrait-painters of the sixteenth
century. Beaumont, in his turn, was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
by John Whitgift, who was already well known
in Cambridge as Master of Peterhouse and
Pembroke, and Fellow of Queens’. Whitgift,
with Matthew Parker and Matthew Hutton, is
one of the three divines who may be taken as
typical of Elizabethan Cambridge—strongly anti-papal
in their sentiments, but keeping nevertheless
a cautious eye on the political balance. It is
hardly necessary to add that Whitgift’s long list
of Cambridge preferments eventually led to the
Archbishoprick of Canterbury. And it was
during his mastership that the greatest intellect
of the age was trained at his college. Under
the yoke of the Aristotelian system of philosophy,
Francis Bacon, while still at Cambridge, perceived
the fallacies of the stereotyped methods
of thought, and laid the foundation of inductive
science. Bacon’s life is connected more intimately
with affairs of state than with his University;
but Trinity regards him as one of the principal
saints in her kalendar, and his memory greets
the visitor at every turn. His portrait is one of
the three at the end of the Hall; there is another
in the Master’s Lodge; his bust, by Roubiliac,
is in the Library; and, in 1845, his statue was
placed, side by side with that of Newton, in the
antechapel.</p>

<p>Bacon is the great figure of this early period.
Nine years older than he, the Lord Chief
Justice Coke (*&nbsp;Whood: bust by Roubiliac) is
the first of the great lawyers connected with
Trinity. Another celebrated name is that of Dr
Donne, Dean of St Paul’s, divine and poet. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Henry Spelman (*&nbsp;Whood), the antiquary and
translator of Xenophon, was a contemporary of
Bacon, and, some years after, Sir Robert Cotton
(*&nbsp;bust by Roubiliac) furnished Trinity with
another archæologist. Whitgift, after his translation
to Canterbury, was succeeded by John
Still, who became Bishop of Bath and Wells.
With Still’s successor, Dr Thomas Nevile,*
master from 1593 to 1615, the second period
opens. Nevile held the Deanery of Canterbury
with his mastership, but his life was spent
in Cambridge, and his architectural work in
Trinity, while it is the most important in the
University, stamps him as the chief benefactor
of the college. In that great age of building,
Nevile’s work has an honourable pre-eminence:
it is the sign of a monumental perseverance and
an artistic taste which, even in that fine era of
Renaissance culture, was never surpassed. We
may with justice echo the words of Fuller, who
says that Dr Nevile performed this work
“answering his anagram <em>most heavenly</em>, and
practising his own allusive motto <i lang="la">ne vile velis</i>.”
Higher praise could not be given. Nevile’s
buildings, if architecture may be considered to
reflect contemporary history, may be regarded as
a turning-point in Cambridge thought. When
we look at the reactionary tendency to the Gothic
taste in Jacobean Oxford, and compare it with
the distinct preference shown in Cambridge for
classical and Renaissance models, the radical
divergence of the two Universities is clear.
Nevile’s courts at Trinity were the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of a long series of collegiate buildings which,
often very defective, took the place of Gothic
work and held it for the next two centuries.
The sole exception to this rule is Matthew
Wren’s chapel at Peterhouse. Besides his
building energy, Nevile acquired land for the
college, so that, when the Society enlarged its
buildings in after years, it found itself in possession
of the requisite site. The King’s Court
occupies part of this property. One can only
say that Nevile’s memory might be honoured
with a better building.</p>

<p>One of the first scholars of Trinity who saw
Nevile’s work in its complete state was George
Herbert. He was born in 1593, the first year
of Nevile’s mastership, and entered Trinity at
a very early age. Although it is more natural
to think of him as a parish priest and the
writer of the most beautiful devotional poetry
in English, his career at Cambridge was not
without distinction. His early Latinity was as
perfect as Milton’s, and he filled the office of
Public Orator of the University. He is unique
among Trinity men as the only important member
of the college who belonged to the most
illustrious school of English churchmen—the
school which, under Andrewes, Laud and Cosin,
placed the Church of England on a logical and
independent footing. The honours of this school
are shared rather unequally between the two
Universities, but Cambridge contributed a substantial
quota to the whole sum. There is no
portrait of Herbert in the college, but he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
commemorated in one of the chapel windows.
He died at the early age of forty, before the
troubles of the Great Rebellion. John Hacket,*
the Royalist Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry,
was probably at Trinity with Herbert. He is
remembered, not so much for his divinity as
for his gallant defence of his cathedral against
the Puritan destroyers. He was born in 1592
and did not die till 1670, ten years after the
Restoration. In his seventieth year, having
been mercifully preserved throughout the troubles,
he desired to bestow some mark of his affection
upon Trinity, “that Society,” as he said with
a noble pathos characteristic of the party to
which he had attached himself, “which is more
precious to me, next to the Church of Jesus
Christ, than any place upon earth.” The result
of his bequest was the present Bishop’s Hostel,
which occupied part of the site of the old
Garret’s or Gerrard’s Hostel.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century is fertile in great
men. During the century, however, none of
the masters of the college were very conspicuous
men, and the mastership, between 1615
and 1683, changed hands no less than twelve
times. It is also worthy of remark that three
successive masters ended their lives as Bishops
of Chester, thus uniting Henry VIII.’s collegiate
foundation with one of his bishopricks. These
were John Wilkins (*&nbsp;Whood), master in
1659, Henry Ferne, master in 1660, and
John Pearson (*&nbsp;Whood), master from 1662
to 1673. This last is the only exception to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the general insignificance of the masters at this
time. He was a distinguished scholar who
had been connected with several colleges, and
had held the mastership of Jesus. His work
on the Apostles’ Creed is still one of the
classics of English theology. About the
middle of the century, Dryden (*&nbsp;Hudson)
came to Trinity from Westminster School.
Both he and Abraham Cowley (*&nbsp;Slaughton)
were strongly attached to the Royalist side
during the Commonwealth disturbances, and
Cowley, who entered the college in 1637 and
proceeded to his master’s degree, was expelled
in 1643 on account of his too strongly expressed
loyalty. He found more congenial
soil at St John’s College, Oxford, the college
of Laud, Juxon, and others of the same party.
If to these poets we add the names of the
naturalists Ray (*&nbsp;Hudson: bust by Roubiliac)
and Willoughby (bust by Roubiliac) we shall
have enumerated the most illustrious Trinity
men of their time. Ray and Willoughby,
who studied natural history with special reference
to its religious character, were, in fact, the
founders of the modern science, just as Dryden
may be said to have struck the first note of
modern poetry.</p>

<p>Pearson became Bishop of Chester in 1672,
and removed there in 1673. Under his
successor, Isaac Barrow, began the golden age
of Trinity. Barrow is, in many ways, the
most extraordinary genius of whom Cambridge
can boast. He was one of that rare class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
whose knowledge is practically universal. He
was born in 1630, a year before his great
contemporary, John Locke, who went up to
Oxford from Westminster about the time when
Barrow went up from Charterhouse to Cambridge.
Barrow was a man of surprising energy
and, at Cambridge, he appears to have read
deeply in every subject which was then studied.
He was classic, mathematician, scientist, theologian,
and orator; and in each of these branches
he excelled. He was appointed Regius Professor
of Greek in 1655, and, subsequently,
Lucasian Professor of Mathematics—a feat
which, to the scholars of to-day, would seem
next to impossible. Undoubtedly, however, his
promotion to the mastership of his college and
his subsequent celebrity were due to his fame
as a divine. His sermons bear the same relation
to his age that those of Jeremy Taylor
bear to the Stewart period. He was in high
favour as a preacher at court, and, on Pearson’s
retirement, his appointment was obvious. He
did not hold the mastership for more than four
years, as in 1677 he died at the age of forty-seven.
His portrait by Hudson hangs in the
college Hall; his bust, by Roubiliac, is in the
Library; and his statue, by Noble, was placed
in the antechapel during the mastership of his
worthy successor, Whewell.</p>

<p>At this time, the mathematical attainments
of the Society must have been overpowering.
Barrow’s fame in this department has perhaps
been obscured by that of Sir Isaac Newton;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but, if we are to believe Newton’s generous
compliment, the early death of Roger Cotes
robbed Trinity of an even greater prodigy.
The college may nevertheless be well content
with Newton, who was emphatically a Trinity
man, spending very little of his life away from
Cambridge. He was twelve years younger than
Barrow, and entered Trinity in the year of the
Restoration, when he was eighteen. Nine years
later, his studies proved so fruitful that Barrow
gave up the Lucasian professorship in his favour.
For more than half a century, he was the chief
ornament of the University. His discoveries
revolutionised the whole theory of mathematics,
and it was owing to his personality that the
subsequent energies of Cambridge were so
largely mathematical. He occupied rooms
between the Great Gateway and the Chapel.
Although he made Cambridge his home, he
had a large share in public business, sitting as
Member for the University and receiving the
mastership of the Mint. This office he probably
owed to another member of the college,
Charles Montague, Earl of Halifax (*&nbsp;Kneller),
whose recall of the specie is among the most
famous of English financial operations. In 1703,
Newton was elected President of the Royal
Society, which, it is interesting to note, had
been founded, forty years before, mainly through
the energy of Dr Wilkins, Master of Trinity
and one of the three Bishops of Chester
mentioned above. Newton was knighted by
Queen Anne in 1705, and died in 1727.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
His scientific studies were not his exclusive
pursuits, for he was, to a certain extent, one
of the group of literary men who are the
glory of Anne’s reign, and was also much
occupied with the elucidation of prophecy,
which probably attracted him from its mathematical
side. Trinity has very justly regarded
him as her greatest son. His portrait, by
Ritz, occupies the place of honour in the Hall,
and every visitor to Cambridge knows—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The antechapel where the statue stood</div>
<div class="verse">Of Newton with his prism and silent face,</div>
<div class="verse">The marble index of a mind for ever</div>
<div class="verse">Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The statue, which is by Roubiliac, and is that
master’s most famous work, bears the inscription
from Lucretius “Qui genus humanum ingenio
superavit.” There is a bust of him in the
Library, also by Roubiliac, and several portraits
are to be found throughout the college.</p>

<p>After Barrow’s death, the mastership was
filled successively by the Hon. John North*
and the Hon. John Montague,* whose rule was
calculated to foster a comfortable laziness rather
than industry. On the death of the second of
these, Dr Richard Bentley, fellow of St John’s,
was elected master. There was, in those days,
a strong feeling of rivalry between the two foundations—not
only academical, but also in political
and social matters. Bentley was a rare genius,
whose scholarship was just then acknowledged
as the finest in England, but he was utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
devoid of good feeling and tact, and had a
peculiar faculty for exciting hatred. His fame,
for the most of us, is due to his high place in
the <cite>Dunciad</cite>. He arrived in Trinity with the
intention of managing the college on his own
lines. There was a party in the Society which
thoroughly enjoyed the comfort of a position it
did not adorn, and in this body Bentley found
his most devoted enemies. Instead of conciliating
them, he treated them with undisguised
contempt and arrogance; and his conduct was
so injudicious that he alienated all the better
members of the college from himself. Matters
came to a head when Bentley made radical
alterations in the Master’s Lodge, and presented
the fellows with a bill considerably larger than
the original estimate. Open war broke out; the
fellows refused to pay; and Bentley in consequence
applied methods of coercion, withholding
privileges which were in his gift. The fellows
found themselves obliged to give in after some
time, and Bentley followed up this victory by
altering the interior of the chapel to suit the new
organ. At this point, however, the Society
revolted for good. Bentley required a large
subscription of each fellow. The fellowship
dividends had been much reduced during the
previous years, and, with this additional burden,
poverty stared many of the dons in the face. In
this crisis, the fellows, who undoubtedly had
justice on their side, called in Serjeant Milne,
a London lawyer and one of their number, and,
under his guidance, addressed a <i lang="la">gravamen</i> against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the Master to the Bishop of Ely. Things
would have gone hardly for Bentley, had not
the Bishop died opportunely. This Bishop, by
the way, was John Moore, whose books George
I. gave to the University Library. However,
Bentley’s tyranny was not suffered to continue,
for, in 1718, the Senate passed a grace degrading
him from his high positions in the University.
After this, the quarrel was less prominent.
Bentley occupied the Lodge till 1742, but the
bad feeling which he had excited continued till
the end of his life. His judgment and taste may
be estimated from the reply which he is said to
have given to some congratulatory address after
his election. Referring to his original college of
St John’s, he said, “By the help of my God, I
have leaped over a wall.” His arrogance might
have been excusable in a young man whose promotion
was early, but Bentley, in 1700, was
past middle life. His scholarship was sound,
and there is no doubt that his arguments against
the Epistles of Phalaris crushed the position of
his adversary Boyle; but his lack of proper
feeling always put him in the wrong, and his
memory lives in the satire of Pope and Swift
rather than in his own work. Hudson’s portrait
of him is in the Hall, and his bust, by Roubiliac,
is in the Library.</p>

<p>The quarrels of Bentley’s mastership form a
period by themselves in the college history. At
the same time, it must be remembered that the
quarrel was confined to a section of the Society,
and that the better members kept aloof from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
It had nevertheless a marked effect on the
college throughout the eighteenth century, with
the consequence that famous names are comparatively
scanty. Of Bentley’s opponents, the
most distinguished was Dr Conyers Middleton,
whose life of Cicero was good enough to merit
a century of abuse. Lesser scholars of the same
time were Roger Gale,* the antiquary, who is
often confounded with the learned Theophilus
Gale of Magdalen, Oxford, author of the once
famous <cite>Court of the Gentiles</cite>; and Beaupré Bell*
of Outwell, Norfolk, who was an enthusiastic
lover of church architecture, and left his valuable
manuscripts to the college library. Bentley’s
immediate successor, Dr Robert Smith,* master
from 1742 to 1768, bequeathed his name to the
Smith’s Prizes. He was succeeded by John
Hinchliffe, Bishop of Peterborough, a typical
prelate of the last century and a born pluralist.
Lord Orford, in his <cite>Tour of the Fens</cite>, describes
his entertainment at the Palace of Peterborough;
from which we may divine that Hinchliffe was
fond of a good dinner and liked the vicinity
of a nobleman. On one occasion, he put a man
with no voice into the Trinity choir, because he
happened to have a vote for Peterborough. A
fellow of the college, named Mansel, who was
more remarkable for his ponderous wit than his
piety, wrote the following epigram:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A singing man, and yet not sing?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">How justify your patron’s bounty?</div>
<div class="verse">Forgive me; you mistake the thing;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">My voice is in another county.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>This same Mansel* came, some years later,
to great dignity as Bishop of Bristol and Master
of Trinity. His mastership, from 1798 to
1820, closes the eighteenth century. The most
distinguished member of the college at this time
was the great Professor of Greek, Richard
Porson,* who died in 1808 at the age of forty-nine.
His beautiful Greek handwriting may be
seen in one of the cases in the college library.
Otherwise, the scholars of the last century are
few and far between. Trinity was, however,
the great nursing-place for noblemen; and
among the number of her sons may be mentioned
the famous Marquess of Granby (*&nbsp;Reynolds)
whose head serves as the sign for so many inns;
John Jefferies Pratt, Marquess Camden and
Chancellor of the University (*&nbsp;Lawrence),
George Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Grafton
(*&nbsp;Lawrence), and, of royal blood, William
Frederick, Duke of Gloucester (*&nbsp;Gainsborough,
Romney, Opie), Chancellor of the University,
and Frederick Augustus, Duke of Sussex
(*&nbsp;Lonsdale). A great statesman of the day
was Spencer Perceval,* who was assassinated in
the lobby of the Houses of Parliament. But, if
we turn to men of letters and poets, we merely
find such men as the parodist, Isaac Hawkins
Browne.*</p>

<p>Lord Byron received his education under
Mansel. His career at Cambridge would be
scarcely worth recording, were he not Byron;
for it is the record of a foolish series of silly
exploits and eccentricities bordering on madness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
The place of honour which is given to his
statue in the library always seems a little better
than his merits. He occupied rooms in Nevile’s
Court, and contrived, during his residence, to
irritate the college authorities. Mansel, as
master, had a very exalted idea of the virtues of
his position, and, from the anecdotes which are
told of him, must have made himself peculiarly
unpleasant. He was the last master of Trinity
who combined that office with episcopal dignity.
His successor, Christopher Wordsworth,*
master from 1820 to 1841, was brother to the
poet, and father of the late saintly Bishop of
Lincoln.</p>

<p>During Wordsworth’s time, the college was
full of great men. Adam Sedgwick* was
Professor of Geology. Another member of the
college was Thomas Babington Macaulay, who
was born with the century. As Fellow of
Trinity, the great historian was thoroughly
identified with the college, and, nine years after
his death, his statue, by Woolner, was placed
among the distinguished society of the antechapel.
Younger by nine years than Macaulay
was Alfred Tennyson (*&nbsp;Watts), who, in a few
exquisite verses, made himself peculiarly the
poet of Trinity. The chief event of his
Cambridge life was, of course, his friendship for
Arthur Henry Hallam, who lived, as is well
known, in the New Court. Tennyson himself
was otherwise not greatly attached to Cambridge.
He lived at some distance from Trinity, in
Corpus Buildings, and went down without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
taking his degree. In this respect, Thackeray
(*&nbsp;Bogle), two years his junior, was very
different from him. Through all his life,
Thackeray, although he was so closely
identified with London, kept his love for
Cambridge, and was at heart a don. While still
in residence, he would walk reading along one
of the paths in the Great Court, and, in after
life, he constantly returned. His rooms were
close to Newton’s, north of the Great Gate.
Probably no one has handled University life
with more success—the subject is proverbially
difficult—than Thackeray in the early chapters
of <cite>Pendennis</cite>; and, in most of his novels, he
sent his heroes to colleges which, whether he
placed them in Oxford or Cambridge, have all
the features of his beloved Trinity.</p>

<p>With Thackeray we are hard on the heels
of our own age. The modern period of
Trinity’s history begins with the mastership
of William Whewell, whose name is inseparable
from his college. The twenty-five years
of his mastership, from 1841 to 1866, form
a very distinguished epoch. As scholar,
organiser, and benefactor to the foundation, he
was pre-eminent. The famous epigram which
said of him that “Science was his forte and
omniscience his foible” was in the main true,
but he carried to everything he attempted an
immense interest and a sound judgment. His
statue very worthily completes the group in
the antechapel. It was erected during the
mastership of his successor, William Hepworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Thompson (*&nbsp;Herkomer) the Platonist, famous
for his erudition and his <i lang="fr">bons mots</i>. Before his
elevation to the mastership, Dr Thompson had
been Regius Professor of Greek. The men
of his generation who belonged to the Society
were men of the highest eminence; the best
known are, perhaps, Joseph Barber Lightfoot
(*&nbsp;Richmond, Dickinson), the commentator on
St Paul’s Epistles and Bishop of Durham;
James Clerk Maxwell,* Professor of Experimental
Physics in the University; the late
Arthur Cayley (*&nbsp;Dickinson), the greatest
mathematician whom Trinity boasts since the
days of Newton; and the Public Orator, W.
G. Clark (bust by Woolner), Thompson’s life-long
friend. When Thompson died in 1886,
he was succeeded by the present master, Dr
Butler, who had been Head Master of Harrow
and Dean of Gloucester. Beneath these rulers,
and with the highest prestige in the world as
her tradition, Trinity fully justifies her distinction
as a royal foundation and a nursing-mother
of sound and religious learning. To select from
the present society is invidious; but the names
of Professor Henry Sidgwick, Professor Michael
Foster (*&nbsp;Herkomer), Dr Henry Jackson (*&nbsp;Furse),
and Professor Jebb, are of European repute, to say
nothing of the present vice-master, Mr Aldis
Wright, editor of Shakspeare, and Mr John
Willis Clark, the present Registrary, whose investigations
in Cambridge history and antiquities
are well known everywhere. In the Church
one may point to the theologian Dr Westcott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Bishop of Durham, to Dr Farrar, Dean of
Canterbury, and to the late Charles Alan
Smythies, Bishop of Zanzibar; among politicians,
to Mr Arthur and Mr Gerald Balfour, and Sir
William Harcourt; while of doctors, lawyers and
men of letters the crowd cannot be numbered.</p>

<h2 id="XVII">XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">EMMANUEL COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">When one hears of the destruction of
the beautiful courts at Emmanuel and
Sidney, one is tempted to wonder what good
genius of building spared the second court of
St John’s and Nevile’s Court at Trinity.
Had Ralph Symons’ work been allowed to
remain here, we should have had a building
almost exactly parallel with the latter. Symons
built courts, but he did not attempt imposing
street-fronts, and the ranges he erected between
1584 and 1586 turned their backs ungraciously
to the road. The entrance to the college was
on the north side, where there is now a smaller
court in the Gothic style of 1840. What is
now known as the Brick Building, east of the
entrance court and at right angles to the south
side, belongs to 1633, but is substantially in
harmony with Symons’ earlier work. It forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a very charming fragment. The classical
transformation of Emmanuel was begun during
Dr Breton’s mastership. Sir Christopher
Wren, who was just completing his chapel
at Pembroke, was invited to design the east
side of the court. It is interesting to observe
how he followed his uncle’s design for the
chapel of Peterhouse, copying the lateral galleries
which connect the chapel with the main buildings.
Wren built these between 1665 and
1677, and it is probable that, when he began
working at Trinity in 1675, he left the completion
of this beautiful composition to his
pupil, Nicholas Hawksmoor. The characteristic
of the whole is a very striking dignity.
Internally, the chapel is less interesting, but
the stained glass, representing noteworthy
members of the college, such as Sancroft,
William Law, and some of the Cambridge
Platonists, is thoroughly suited to the fine,
plain windows. The northern gallery is the
picture-gallery of the Master’s Lodge as well
as an approach to the chapel, and contains a
number of fine portraits, including a Lely,
two Gainsboroughs and two Romneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>In the last century the revival which Wren
had innocently inaugurated swept away Symons’
building. In 1719 the south side of the court
was rebuilt; the gigantic pilasters in the centre
are a proof of how bad the Palladian work of
that over-abused period could be. Sir James
Burrough of Caius, who for half a century was
the architectural dictator of Cambridge, designed
new north and west buildings, obeying the unconquerable
desire of the day for an eloquent
façade. Because the design is Burrough’s, this
addition is tolerable and more or less appropriate
to the chapel; but Burrough died before it was
begun, and this, like the Clare chapel, is a posthumous
and probably slanderous addition to his
fame. At all events the work was entrusted to
Essex, who carried it out before 1770. It is
perhaps significant that Essex was chosen, a
year or two later, to compare his work once
more to Wren’s, this time at Trinity. The
western cloister, which recalls the similar but
earlier building at Pembroke, is heavy but not
unsuccessful. Essex had his own way with the
Hall, which is probably the least agreeable hall
in Cambridge. It is cold and stiff, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
plaster roof brings bad taste to a climax. In
the Gothic court north of this is the Library,
which corresponds to the refectory of the old
Dominican house—the Hall is on the site of
the chapel. It was, till the Restoration, the
college chapel. Sancroft, to whose initiative
Wren’s work is due, gave it a valuable collection
of old books, chiefly Bibles, and its
Oriental manuscripts were carefully described
by Sir William Jones. The chief modern
addition to Emmanuel is the large brick building
at the east end of the college garden.
This, although not remarkable in itself, is
interesting as the pioneer of an attempt to
revive the economical principle of the medieval
hostel. It also forms a not unfitting termination
to the pretty lawn, with its pond and tennis-courts.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The pure house of Emmanuel” occupies
the site of the house of Dominican
Friars outside Barnwell Gate. At the dissolution
the buildings were left untouched, and,
when Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the
Exchequer and Treasurer of the Household,
came into possession of the land, he had his
materials for a college all ready. Sir Walter
was a strong Puritan, and was on that account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
no great favourite with Queen Elizabeth. She
met him one day and said, “Sir Walter, I hear
that you have erected a Puritan foundation.”
Sir Walter, however, disclaimed the insinuation,
“No, Madam; far be it from me to countenance
anything contrary to your established laws; but
I have set an acorn, which, when it becomes an
oak, God alone knows what will be the fruit
thereof.” The acorn, nevertheless, grew into a
very Puritan oak. The buildings seem to have
been erected in a curious spirit; for, if not Sir
Walter, at all events his executors, revelled in
the fact that the secular buildings of the foundation
stood upon the Friary church, and did all
they could to obliterate the monastic plan of the
buildings. But, beyond this unnecessary manifestation
of spite, the college was admirably
governed and its students were—and all through
its history have been—serious and law-abiding.
Sir Walter founded it as “a College of Theology,
Science, Philosophy, and Literature, for the extension
of the pure Gospel of Christ our only
Mediator, to the honour and glory of Almighty
God,” and appointed, as its first master, Dr
Laurence Chaderton, who ruled the college for
thirty-eight years, and had a great part in the
Authorised Version of the Bible. Under Dr
Chaderton, the foundation increased in learning
and godliness, and Fuller said of it, “Sure I am,
at this day it hath overshadowed all the Universities,
more than a moiety of the present
masters of colleges being bred therein.” Dr
Branthwaite* of Caius, Dr Whichcot* of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
King’s, Dr Samuel Ward* of Sidney, and the
famous Ralph Cudworth* of Clare and Christ’s,
all held fellowships at Emmanuel.</p>

<p>As time went on, the Puritanism of Emmanuel
became more and more pronounced.
The services in the chapel savoured of Congregationalism
and were altogether opposed to the
Laudian revival of church life and doctrine.
Under the first Dr Sancroft, the college ritual
was thus reported to the Archbishop, “They
receive that Holy Sacrament, sitting upon forms
about the Communion Table, and do pull the
Loaf one from the other, after the minister hath
begun. And so the Cup, one drinking as it
were to another, like good fellows, without any
particular application of the said words, more
than once for all.” This expression of shocked
piety has nothing in its wording which allows
us to expect exaggeration. The servers at the
altar were also “Fellows’ subsizars,” and not in
holy orders. However, one fails to see any
extravagant Protestantism in this arrangement.
Emmanuel chapel must have presented a strange
contrast to Wren’s and Cosin’s chapel at Peterhouse,
or to the chapel at Queens’ which Dowsing
ransacked so unceremoniously. The college,
meanwhile, was the nursery of American colonisers,
and has therefore always been a goal of
American pilgrimage. Mr Everett’s bombastic
passage on the subject has been often quoted;
its eloquence is scarcely of the finest type. But,
in company with a row of Pilgrim Fathers,
Emmanuel produced John Harvard, the founder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of the greatest American University, and may
therefore be called the mother of American
education.</p>

<p>But, in common with St John’s and other
colleges, Emmanuel lost its Puritanism with
years. The Restoration brought in a better
state of feeling, and, under the second Dr
Sancroft and his successors, Doctors Breton*
and Holbech,* the college devoted its energies
to building. William Sancroft became Archbishop
of Canterbury, and kept up the traditions
of his college in refusing to acknowledge
James II.’s Declaration. He was the chief of
the seven bishops who signed the famous petition
against that document. Afterwards, as a non-juror,
he resigned his archbishoprick. But the
best of all the sons of Emmanuel was another
non-juror, William Law, who was for many
years a fellow, and held the living of King’s
Cliffe in Northamptonshire. This great man
has become better known to the world since the
publication of his biography by Canon Overton,
and the reprinting of his letters to Bishop
Hoadly. He was a staunch and able supporter
of the Church’s principles, but his most abiding
monument is the half mystical but intensely
practical treatise called <cite>A Serious Call to a Devout
and Holy Life</cite>. The book has had an influence
second only to that of the <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, and
its wide application may be judged from the fact
that it affected people so widely different as
Dr Johnson and Richard Hurrell Froude. Its
simple but vivid style and its picturesque quaintness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
account very largely for its popularity.
In later years, Law, a solitary and meditative
man, took up the half-understood ideas of
German mysticism, and became a blind disciple
of Jacob Behmen. These later aberrations have
somewhat eclipsed his legitimate fame. The
college has commemorated him by a window
in the chapel. In connection with Law, it is
interesting to remember that another mystical
writer, Joseph Hall, Bishop, first of Exeter and
afterwards of Norwich, was a fellow of Emmanuel.
There is a portrait of Hall in the
splendid collection at the Lodge, in which he
is represented as wearing a gold medal. This
medal was given him by the States General as a
recognition of his services at the Synod of Dort,
and the original is still in the possession of the
college.</p>

<p>There is also, in the same collection, an
admirable portrait of Sancroft, who, beyond his
contributions to the new chapel, was a great
benefactor to the library. This library is one
of the most valuable in Cambridge. Bishop
Bedell of Kilmore, who pursued his studies at
Emmanuel with great success, and was a fellow
of the college, left it a Hebrew Bible which he
had bought for its weight in silver. Among
other treasures it contains a MS. of Chrysostom
and a copy of Wyclif’s Bible, with the inscription
“Ihū help us, for we ben feble.” To
return to the portraits in the Master’s Lodge.
We find there an excellent portrait of that
accomplished diplomat and typical prig, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
William Temple, by Lely. And, among other
seventeenth-century worthies, we are glad to see
the portrait of the greatest of Cambridge builders,
Ralph Symons, “Effigies Radulphi Simons,”
the inscription goes, “Architecti sua aetate
peritissimi qui praeter plurima aedificia ab eo
praeclare facta, duo collegia Emanuelis hoc
Sydneii illud exstruxit integre. Magnam etiam
partem Trinitatis reconcinnavit amplissime.”</p>

<p>After the time of Law and the non-jurors,
the history of Emmanuel is very quiet, and the
stately ease for which its buildings are conspicuous
possessed the college. During the
mastership of Dr William Richardson,* in
1765, a member of the college published a
book which had a tremendous effect on English
literature. This was the <cite>Reliques of Ancient
English Poetry</cite>, collected by Bishop Percy of
Dromore. The labours of this antiquarian are
a lasting glory to his college. A similar taste
was apparent in Richardson’s successor, “rare”
Richard Farmer (*&nbsp;Romney) who was master
from 1775 to 1797. The love of himself and
his <i lang="fr">coterie</i> for Shakspeare took him, night after
night, to the theatre at Stourbridge Fair, and
his affection for the drama combined with his
good-fellowship made him something of a
curiosity at the time when most college masters
were dry and pedantic. To the same period
belongs Samuel Parr, whose pipe, tobacco-box,
and stopper are preserved by the College. He
was undoubtedly a wit and a good talker, but his
jokes were lengthy and pompous, and he scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
deserves the praise of those admirers who have
likened him to Dr Johnson and Sydney Smith.
For most of us, possibly, he lives entirely by
virtue of de Quincey’s essay upon him.</p>

<p>The two most famous scholars whom
Emmanuel produced in the eighteenth century
were Joshua Barnes,* Professor of Greek at
its beginning, and Richard Hurd,* Bishop in
succession of Lichfield and Worcester, who
died in 1808. Hurd was a theologian with a
somewhat dull pen, and is now chiefly remembered
as the disciple, friend and biographer
of Bishop Warburton. At the beginning of this
century Sir Busick Harwood, a scientific man
greatly in advance of his age, was Professor of
Anatomy. Gell, the antiquary and explorer
of Pompeii, who died in 1836, was also an
Emmanuel man. But the present century,
although the standard of work and scholarship
has been high, is not prolific in eminent
names. Our greatest living historian, Dr
Creighton, held a fellowship at Emmanuel
according to the terms of the Dixie Professorship,
but Cambridge cannot count him as her
own. At present, the college is rapidly increasing
in numbers and emulates the modern
popularity of Pembroke; and it has the distinction,
rare at Cambridge, of success on the
river and in the schools alike.</p>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Ralph Symons, the great Cambridge
builder whose name deserves to be more
widely known than it is, was the architect chosen
to superintend the works at Sidney. He was
employed on Nevile’s Court at Trinity, and was,
a year or two later, to begin operations in the
second court of St John’s. Sidney, which was
ready at the beginning of 1599, was quite comparable
with those famous works of art. As
usual, the architect did not attempt to manage
a street-front. Here, however, instead of turning
the back of his buildings to the street, as at
Emmanuel, he constructed an oblong three-sided
court, whose eastern side directly fronted
the street. In 1628 Sir Francis Clerke of
Houghton Conquest completed a second court
on similar lines. The south side of one court
thus became the north side of the other. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
common side, which exactly bisects the building,
was terminated by a gateway opening on the
street and into either court. In this original
plan the entrance to the Hall was immediately
in the centre of the eastern range of the north
court; the entrance to the Chapel occupied a
similar position in the south court. We are
still able to admire this graceful and simple plan.
But of the original buildings the only remaining
traces are the oriels in the garden-front of the
Master’s Lodge. In 1776 Essex, who had for
the last ten years been “improving” Cambridge
out of knowledge, built a new chapel; and in
1830, while Dr Chafy was master—the names
of these masters deserve to be handed down—it
was decided to thoroughly remodel the
college in the new Gothic style. This step
was prompted simply by the admiration which
Wilkins’ doings at Corpus, Trinity, and King’s
had excited. Each college glowed with pious
emulation, and Sidney chose for its destroyer
Sir Jeffrey Wyattville, who had Gothicised a
great part of Windsor Castle. Wyattville overhauled
the college in the Vandal manner;
removed all traces, save those I have referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to, of Symons’ obsolete work, and replaced it
by the present pretentious and insipid structure
which adorns the eastern side of Sidney Street.
It is a comfort to know that a later generation has
made amends for this criminal error of taste. A
court, or rather two sides of a court, with cloisters,
have been added in recent years by the late Mr
John Loughborough Pearson. This range of
buildings, not very obvious owing to the high
walls behind which it stands, is of red brick,
and, like many other new buildings in Cambridge,
is in the style of the French Renaissance with
English modifications. It is certainly one of
Mr Pearson’s great successes, and is, moreover,
a success in a line which he seldom attempted.
The court—which contains, by the way, a very
fine Combination Room—is one of the most
retired spots in Cambridge, and in its studious
shades it is possible to forget Wyattville’s
ravages.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In 1589 died an excellent lady, Frances Lady
Sussex, widow of the second Earl. She
was the daughter of Sir William Sidney, and
would in any case have achieved a negative distinction
as the wife of Thomas Radcliffe and
the aunt of Sir Philip Sidney. But in her will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
she left a legacy of five thousand pounds, to be
employed by her executors in the foundation of
a college at Cambridge, or, in case the bequest
were insufficient, in enlarging Clare Hall. Six
years later, the executors bought a site from
Trinity College. When Henry VIII. founded
Trinity, he made over to it the lands of the
Franciscan Friary which, until the dissolution,
had occupied the space between the modern
Sidney Street and the King’s Ditch. The
buildings were apparently taken down and used
as a quarry for Henry’s new college. Thus the
site was vacant, and the executors, after making
a preliminary payment of a hundred marks, took
over the ground on a perpetual lease, and engaged
to pay a rent of £13. 6s. 8d. yearly. These
executors, the actual founders of Sidney, were
the Earl of Kent and Sir John Harrington, the
translator of Ariosto. The college was called
the College of the Lady Frances Sidney Sussex,
and took her arms, Radcliffe impaling Sidney.
The pheon, the heraldic symbol of the Sidneys,
is the badge of the college, and, like the eagle
of St John’s and the silver crescent of Trinity
Hall, has given its title to the college magazine
of our own days.</p>

<p>The first master was appointed in 1598.
He was Dr James Montagu,* and became
Bishop of Winchester, where he died in 1618.
But, in spite of this augury, the history of
Sidney is the reverse of prelatical. Of late
years, the college has somewhat retrieved its
past record, but, on the whole, its distinction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Puritan. It is, however, a college whose history
finds its centre in one event, and that event
is vague and shadowy. In the college books,
under the date April 23rd, 1616, is the following
inscription, “Oliverus Cromwell, Huntingdoniensis,
admissus ad commensum sociorum
Aprilis vicesimo sexto; Tutore Magᵒ Ricardo
Howlet.” Few colleges boast such a fellow-commoner.
The note which follows, written
in after years by a good Royalist, is worth
transcribing: “Hic fuit grandis ille impostor,
carnifex perditissimus, qui, pientissimo rege
Carolo primo nefaria caede sublato, ipsum
usurpavit thronum, et tria regna per quinque
ferme annorum spatium, sub protectoris nomine,
indomita tyrannide vexavit.” Vexavit, as
Polonius would say, is good. No language
is more abusive than aptly handled Latin!
This “big impostor and most damn’d butcher”
stayed at Cambridge till July, 1617, and then,
like many great men, left without taking his
degree. His contribution to the social life of
his college has been stigmatised as discreditable,
but this is probably invidious rumour and nothing
more. The window of his room—which, by
the way, dates from 1827 or thereabout—is
still shown to the credulous. There is an
admirable portrait of him in the hall, which
was presented to the college, with a rather
unnecessary parade of anonymity, by Mr Holles
of the Hyde in Essex.</p>

<p>The great name of Cromwell must not, however,
suffer us to forget the names of the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and pious men whom Sidney has nurtured. Dr
Edmund Calamy, the famous Nonconformist
divine, was a member of the college. So was
Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man.
So, too, were Jones of Nayland, the revivalist
and hymn-writer, and an even more famous
Evangelical preacher, Thomas Cecil. Sidney
had, indeed, a very conspicuous share in the
revival of spiritual life at the end of the
last century. On the other hand, the college
produced, by way of an anomaly, Sir Roger
l’Estrange, the Royalist pamphleteer, whose
sympathies were certainly apart from his education.
The laborious antiquary, Thomas Rymer
of the <cite>Fœdera</cite>, was also a Sidney man. In our
own century it has been recorded that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There was a young man of Sid. Sussex</div>
<div class="verse">Who stated that w + x</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was the same as xw!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">So they said, “We will trouble you</div>
<div class="verse">To confine those ideas to Sid. Sussex.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But any such misconception has been rectified
by the present master, Mr Charles Smith, whose
mathematical text-books are classics in their
own branch of literature. And, among living
members of the college, we may notice the
present Bishop of Bloemfontein, Dr John
Wale Hicks, who is not only celebrated for
his equal skill in medicine and divinity, but, as
tutor of his college and vicar of Little St Mary’s,
has had perhaps the greatest spiritual influence
on modern Cambridge life. Although Sidney is
a small college, there is none which is so remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
for the patriotism and good-fellowship
existing among its undergraduates; and, within
very recent years, it has supplied the University
with excellent athletes, and one of its members
has become president of the Union.</p>

<span class="smaller">DOWNING COLLEGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">James Wilkins, the builder of Downing,
must be distinguished from the later
William Wilkins, the gothic experimentalist.
If the second Wilkins had worked in the
manner of the first, we should have missed
some valuable historical relics, but should have
gained in other respects. Downing, with its
heavy angularities and immense porticoes, is not
a very great advance on the plans so cherished
by Mr James Essex, but it bears the marks of
a good intention, and is an excellently proportioned
building. It was begun in 1807,
but has never been finished, and now simply
consists of two parallel ranges running north
and south, with a wide space of lawn between
them. Its situation is very remote, but to this
it owes its chief beauty, the lovely park with
its fine avenues. The view northwards from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the park, embracing the fellows’ garden, and
ending in the towers of the new Roman
Catholic Church, is worth seeing, although
the contrast of the classical college with one
of the latest examples of modern Gothic work
is somewhat inharmonious.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Downing is almost the youngest of Cambridge
colleges, and its history is chiefly
concerned with its foundation. At Gamlingay,
in the only part of Cambridgeshire that can be
called picturesque, there lived from about 1680
to 1749, a baronet named Sir George Downing.
He had been the victim of a compulsory marriage.
At the early age of fifteen, he had been married
to his cousin Mary Forester, who herself was
only thirteen. They never lived together, and
in 1717, Sir George made a will by which he
bequeathed his estates to some collateral relatives.
This document contained the provision that, if
his heirs died out, the estates were to be applied
to the use of a college which his trustees should
found in Cambridge. He nevertheless outlived
the trustees, and, dying in 1749, left his property
to his collateral heir, Sir Jacob Downing. Sir
Jacob was married, but died without issue in
1764. His wife retained the estates, but this
gave rise to a long lawsuit, and, at her death,
Chancery pronounced the original will to be
valid. The Charter was granted in 1800,
but the buildings were not begun till 1807,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and the college was not in working order till
1821.</p>

<p>Sir George Downing’s design had included a
master and sixteen fellows. In addition—presumably
to confer some prestige upon a late
foundation—he had provided for two professorships
in connection with the college, the Downing
Professorships of Medicine and of the Laws of
England. Although the influx of undergraduates
was at first very small, the valuable law
scholarships attracted many students in course
of time. The second master, Mr Serjeant
Frere,* was an eminent lawyer, and is still
renowned as the first of college masters who
dispensed their hospitality without too keen an
eye to rigid selection. Dr Annesley, the first
master, from 1805 to 1812, was the head of a
college which had no corporate existence, and
Mr Frere, for nine years, was in a similar position.
Downing has the misfortune of being in
a very remote, although charming situation, and
the number of her undergraduates has never been
very large. But her present society includes the
Professor of Law, Dr Maitland; and her master,
Dr Alexander Hill, is a distinguished ornament
of the medical school. And, among the doctors
who have been educated at Downing are the late
Sir George Humphrey, Professor Latham, and
one of the best known of living physicians,
Professor Bradbury.</p>

<h2 id="XX">XX<br />
<span class="smaller">SELWYN COLLEGE, ETC.</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The memory of George Augustus Selwyn, the
great Bishop, first of Melanesia, afterwards
of Lichfield, is honoured in Cambridge by the
latest of all the colleges. Selwyn, one of a
famous Cambridge family, died in 1877; and in
1882, Selwyn College was opened. The object
of the college is that which had, some time
before, prompted the foundation of Keble—the
provision of University education at a more
moderate rate than had hitherto been the case.
It is conducted on what is known as the hostel
system; that is to say, its members, while enjoying
all University privileges, have all their meals
in common, and are supplied with most necessaries
at fixed rates from the college buttery.
This is, we may believe, the simple system out
of which great foundations like Trinity grew;
and, since Selwyn began it, one or two other
colleges have pursued it with some success on a
voluntary principle. At Selwyn, however, the
hostel life is compulsory; and the college is
known officially as Selwyn Hostel. It has not
lived long enough to produce any great sons as
yet, but its record is honourable, and we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
expect much from it in the future.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Its buildings,
forming two sides of a quadrangle, are of red
brick, and were designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield,
who also built the Master’s Lodge at the east
corner of the enclosure. As the essence of the
college’s existence is to provide accommodation
for students, the buildings are devoted to rooms,
and the Hall and Chapel were left to the last.
For the first thirteen years of the history of the
college, these necessities of college life were
supplied by the low range of temporary buildings
just inside the entrance gate. There, too, for
some time to come the Hall will have to remain,
a very simple room, whose only ornament is the
portrait of Mr Arthur Lyttelton, late master and
now vicar of Eccles. This, by Mr C. W.
Furse, is a striking example of the New English
school. In 1895, however, one of the wishes of
the college was fulfilled, and the present noble
Chapel was erected from Sir Arthur Blomfield’s
design. It stands north of the Master’s Lodge,
and is a very large and lofty building of red brick,
with freestone dressings. The style is a free
adaptation of English Perpendicular, the admirable
window tracery being a remarkable feature. The
interior is very good, and the very complete set
of stalls, with their grotesque carvings and modern
misereres, would do honour to a medieval
collegiate church. Its consecration by the Bishop
of Ely in October, 1895, was one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
imposing ceremonies which have been seen of
late years in Cambridge. The late Archbishop
of Canterbury and several other prelates assisted
at the function, and the sermon at mid-day was
preached by the Archbishop. If the pious
founders of the older colleges had been able to be
present, and had seen the whole college walk in
procession round the quadrangle in the early
morning, singing the sixty-eighth psalm, and had
assisted at the celebration of the Holy Eucharist
which followed, they would assuredly have
thanked God that the traditions of their Church
and of the University which was its daughter
were preserved and cherished by more modern
foundations.</p>

<p>Ridley Hall represents a school of thought
somewhat different from that to which Selwyn
owes its being, and is altogether a modern
development in University life. Like Selwyn, it
has an Oxford counterpart in Wycliffe Hall. It
was founded in 1879 as a training college for
those who, having already graduated from
some college, wish to proceed to Holy Orders.
Under the headship of Doctor Moule, it has
already sent out several distinguished members
of the Evangelical party, and has also been of
great service to missionary societies. It has
certainly proved itself a power in modern Cambridge,
chiefly through the influence of its eminent
principal; and has encouraged other religious
bodies to attempt what is an accomplished fact
in Oxford. The Presbyterian body are now
building themselves a large theological college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at the corner of the Madingley Road. The
buildings of Ridley are not unlike those of
Selwyn, and the Renaissance chapel with its
picturesque iron turret is a pleasing object from
most points of view. The architect of the older
portion was Mr Charles Luck; the chapel and
southern range were designed by Mr W. Wallace.</p>

<p>After many vicissitudes, Ayerst Hall has at
length disappeared. Some years ago the Rev.
W. Ayerst of Caius College established a small
college on the hostel principle, which occupied
the buildings now known as Queen Anne’s
Terrace, between Parker’s Piece and the University
Cricket Ground. In 1894 his students
vacated these buildings for a new range between
the Huntingdon and Madingley Roads, and their
original home is now the offices of the University
Correspondence College. Rather less than
three years later, the venture was abandoned, and
the new buildings were purchased for a colony of
Benedictines. Since the building of the great
church of Our Lady of the Assumption and
the English Martyrs, which is so conspicuous a
feature from the railway, the influx of Roman
Catholic students has been much greater. In
1896 a Roman Catholic chaplaincy was founded
in both Universities. The direct result of this
measure was the purchase of Ayerst Hall and
the establishment of a theological school for
Roman Catholic undergraduates. This scheme
is in its infancy, and its future remains to be
seen. The new hostel is known as Edmund
House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Another abortive attempt was Cavendish
College, founded in 1882, which took its name
and coat-of-arms from the late Duke of Devonshire.
By an irony of fate, it is the only
collegiate building which the passer-by sees from
the train—that is, unless he keeps a sharp lookout
for King’s Chapel. It was, however, a mile
from the nearest college, on the furthest outskirts
of the town, and, after a precarious existence, it
failed and was closed in 1891. Between 1891
and 1895 the curious might roam through its
halls unchecked, inspect the deserted library and
the singularly comfortable buildings, and muse on
the names of departed occupants inscribed on the
staircases. Some of its students went down;
others joined other colleges. In 1895 it was
bought by Mr J. C. Horobin of Homerton, who
transferred to it his training-college for schoolmasters
and schoolmistresses. Its part in University
life is not over yet, but its proud title has
been exchanged for the more suburban name of
Homerton, and now only old-fashioned people
call it Cavendish.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is Fitzwilliam Hall. The same
desire which led to the foundation of Selwyn
and Keble led to the passing of a grace by the
Senate of both Universities, by which students
were allowed to become members of the University
without joining any particular college.
Unattached students now form a considerable
element at both Oxford and Cambridge. The
necessity for a certain amount of combination
goes, nevertheless, without saying; and its result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
is Fitzwilliam Hall. A house opposite the
Fitzwilliam Museum has been purchased, and
has been turned into a club for non-collegiate
students. There are a reading-room, lecture
rooms, and rooms for the tutors, who are, for the
most part, distinguished members of the older
foundations. The non-collegiates have their
own gown, their boat on the river, and their
own clubs and societies; and, although some of
their most promising members in time join other
colleges, they have a distinct corporate life and
status of their own. Thus, although Cambridge
has in none of these respects been in front of her
traditionally conservative sister, she has at all
events followed not very far behind her in any.</p>

<h2 id="XXI">XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">GIRTON AND NEWNHAM</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">A few words must be devoted to these
foundations, which, it cannot be doubted,
are destined to play so important a part in the
future life of the University. In the last chapter,
I said that some of the founders would have
rejoiced to see a ceremony so much in keeping
with traditional usage as the consecration of
Selwyn Chapel. It is at least doubtful whether
Henry VI. would have looked with approval on
the lady students who are so assiduous worshippers
at his chapel; and even his imperious consort,
the foundress of Queens’, and the Lady Margaret
herself, with her rooms in Christ’s, would have
probably hesitated to admit their own sex to the
privileges of University life. But “the old order
changeth,” and colleges for women are not only
accomplished facts, but facts which are very
lively indeed. Till within the last half century,
the University’s estimate of the rights of women
was very oriental: unmarried fellows were the
rule, and masters’ wives formed a very distinct
social clique. But the breaking-down of these
barriers came in time, and, with the ensuing
civilisation, came the project for giving women
the privileges of University education. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
know what women’s minds are,” wrote Erasmus
scornfully of his patroness to a friend. The Professors
who to-day occupy Erasmus’ numerous
chairs have plenty of opportunity of seeing that
women’s minds are not to be dismissed in a
phrase. At any rate, woman has stormed
Cambridge, and made a considerable breach in
the fortifications, and the most doctrinaire of
conservatives cannot keep her from the closely
guarded citadel of the degree.</p>

<p>Girton is the earlier of the two colleges. It
was started at Hitchin in 1869, and was removed
to Cambridge in 1873. Even then it planted
itself outside the hallowed precinct, on the brow
of a hill, beside the straightest of all straight
roads. Every Girton student knows, to her
cost, the long avenue of telegraph posts which
separates her from Cambridge; and although
this approach, in fine weather, provides excellent
landscapes in Hobbéma’s best manner, in wet
weather it is exceptionally dismal. She has her
compensation, however, in the beautiful view
which her college commands; and the buildings,
although externally of rather various merit, are
inside as comfortable as any in modern Cambridge.
The style of the building is a mixed Gothic, and
the older parts have a very mellow, aged look,
but the entrance tower and its wings are built of
a singularly disagreeable brick, which, one may
hope, will in time be concealed by ivy or some
other creeper. The college takes its name from
the village of Girton, about half a mile to the
north. The church of Girton is worth seeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Newnham, which is in Cambridge itself, is
a later foundation, but its progress has been
astonishing. It also takes its name from a
suburban village which has gradually become
part of the town. The buildings of Newnham
form a very imposing array, and are a remarkable
contrast, with their Renaissance gables, to
the Gothic buildings of Selwyn, just across the
road. Mr Basil Champneys has produced in
them one of the best modern imitations of
French Renaissance; and their outline, seen at
a favourable distance, would not be unworthy
of Chambord or Chenonceaux. The oldest
part is the Old Hall, forming the south-eastern
angle of the college; this belongs to 1875.
Then came Clough Hall on the north side.
Sidgwick Hall followed it, and completed
this side, and, in 1894, two sides of a quadrangle
were finished and the Old Hall joined
to the rest by the erection of the Pfeiffer
Building. In this latest part of the college
is the principal gateway, now closed by a
double gate of beautiful ironwork, in memory
of the first principal, Miss Clough. In the
hall are portraits of Miss Clough, Professor and
Mrs Sidgwick, and Miss M. G. Kennedy, by
Mr J. J. Shannon, and one (by Richmond) of
Miss Helen Gladstone, who till lately was one
of the leading Newnham dons. Young as they
are, both Girton and Newnham have their history,
and are able to inspire their students with
a patriotism which is the natural result of extraordinary
perseverance and hardly-won victories.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Fond tradition would compel us to accept
the so-called School of Pythagoras as
the <i lang="la">fons et origo</i> of the medieval University.
However, the legend does not go for very
much, and we may suppose that, until the
foundation of several colleges brought about the
necessity of a common centre, education was
carried on in the numerous monastic houses
or by private teachers at their own lodgings.
The present schools, within the limits of the
University Library, are probably in part of the
fourteenth century, but, for the most part,
belong to the latter half of the next century.
They are not very conspicuous, and probably
ninety-nine out of a hundred Cambridge men
have never been inside them, as the majority of
public examinations are held in the Senate
House and the various large halls of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
town is full. They are, moreover, so incorporated
in the Library as to form part of
the building, and have no very distinctive mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus22">

<p class="caption">The Senate House</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The architectural history of the Library is
singularly complex. It occupies two quadrangles
north of and running parallel with
King’s Chapel. The first of these is the
quadrangle of the schools, and is entered from
the open space between the Senate House and
King’s; the second occupies the site of the
original quadrangle of King’s, and is entered
from the opposite side. Mr G. G. Scott has
restored the old gateway with some success, and
it forms a good contrast to the opposite gateway
at Clare. Round these courts are grouped the
very various Library buildings. The Library
itself is entered from the eastern side, to which
it presents a very stiff classical front. Somewhere
between 1470 and 1480, the great
prelate, Thomas Rotherham, then fellow of
King’s and Bishop of Lincoln, built a Perpendicular
façade on this side; and this was
the beginning of the buildings. Hitherto the
few books which the Library contained, mostly
bequeathed by Dr Richard Holme in 1424,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had been placed in the present south gallery on
the first floor of the quadrangle. The opposite
gallery was then the Senate House. The
western gallery, above the school of Canon
Law, overlooked the Court of King’s.
Rotherham thus completed the first quadrangle,
and, until the eighteenth century, the Library
was contained in the eastern, southern and
western rooms. Mr Clark, in his picturesque
notes on Cambridge, assures us that it must
have been hopelessly neglected. The days of
building prelates were long past when, in 1715,
George I., for some unknown reason, purchased
the library of Dr John Moore, Bishop in
succession of Norwich and Ely, and presented
it to the University. Just about the same time,
he had sent a regiment to enforce loyalty on
Oxford. The epigrams which passed between
the Tory and Whig Universities on this
occasion have been so often quoted as to need
no repetition. The Oxford epigram takes the
palm for neatness, but the Cambridge retort was
the last word on the subject.</p>

<p>However, although King George’s gift cannot
be valued too highly as a benefaction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Cambridge, and was also an incentive to wit of a
very felicitous order, it was in one way rather unfortunate.
The books were many; accommodation
was small. It was proposed to place the
addition in what was then the Senate House,
and to build a new meeting-place for the
University. Mr Burrough of Caius submitted
a plan for the new Senate House, of which we
can see the result to-day. The quadrangle was
thus entirely given over to the Library. It
must have formed one of the most beautiful
in Cambridge; to-day the western room, running
between the two courts, has one of the
best interiors in any library. But the age was
hostile to medieval buildings. With architects
like Burrough and Gibbs—excellent architects,
both of them—carrying out their classical
designs on either side, the Library was not
suffered to remain unmolested. The University
decided to harmonise it with these structures.
In 1754 Rotherham’s front was destroyed, and
the present Georgian façade was put up, which,
after all, harmonises very badly with the Senate
House. Rotherham’s gateway was bought by
the owner of Madingley Hall, and is now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
entrance to the stables there. It is much to be
regretted, for the present aspect of the Library
is singularly ignoble. The interior, however,
offers a better contrast. From the classical east
room, which, with all its plastered ugliness, is
certainly stately and not inappropriate, we pass
into the Catalogue Room, once the Senate
House. Somebody adorned this room with a
plaster ceiling in the last century, but the old
timber roof is being restored. In the west
room, which contains some valuable woodwork,
we go back further into antiquity, and, when we
have completed the circuit of the Library, we
shall have seen a series of buildings which, in
their diversity, are thoroughly characteristic of
Cambridge.</p>

<p>The present century has added enormously to
the Library. King’s transferred itself finally to
the other side of the chapel when Wilkins
finished his range of buildings—that is, approximately
in 1830. Soon after this the important
<i lang="fr">annexe</i> which now constitutes the whole north
side of the Library was added. Its architect
was Mr C. R. Cockerell. It is a colossal
building, and its external ugliness may be fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
appreciated from the old King’s quadrangle,
where all the buildings in front of it have been
cleared away. Its interior, almost entirely
devoted to theology, is as fine and imposing
as its exterior is hideous, and is, moreover, a
very agreeable room for students. Here the
more remarkable manuscripts are exhibited,
among which the famous Codex Bezae has
the place of honour. Theodore Béza, whose
name is in the first rank of Biblical critics,
saved it from the sack of the monastery of
St Irénée at Lyons in 1562, and presented it
to the University—a gift worthy of the academy
in which Erasmus had laid the foundations of
Scriptural study. At the west end of the same
building are the statues of George I. (by
Rysbrack) and George II. (by Wilton) which
used to stand in the Senate House. Cockerell’s
work finds its antithesis in the opposite side of
the court, which was rebuilt by Sir Gilbert
Scott on a thoroughly medieval plan. Scott
also added a second storey to this side, which,
like Cockerell’s building, was continued into the
eastern court. He also entirely refaced the front
opposite King’s Chapel. The effect is uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
but gloomy. His son completed the existing
Library by restoring the western façade. The
rooms on the ground floor are also appropriated
to books, principally modern and lighter
literature, but contain nothing worth seeing.
Cockerell’s building is an exception, for its
ground floor is occupied by the Woodwardian
Museum of Geology.</p>

<p>In spite of the misfortunes which it brought
about, the Senate House is one of those buildings
which gave Cambridge its greatest dignity.
One may hesitate to compare it with the Radcliffe
Library at Oxford, which was finished
about twenty-five years later, but it is largely
due to the same architect and is certainly an
addition to his credit. Gibbs had, however,
only a small share in the work, for Burrough
is its real designer. It is an oblong building,
with entrances on the east and on the middle
of the south sides. It has a double range of
windows throughout, save on the west side,
where they are blank. Those in the upper
storey are round-headed, those in the lower
are square-headed and are surmounted by plain
architraves, alternately round and pointed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
whole building is surrounded by an order of
composite pilasters, cut square save near the
doors, where they are round and fluted. Above
the cornice is a balustrade, broken judiciously by
the pediments of the entrances, which give the
building its distinctive feature. The whole is
one of the best specimens of early Georgian
architecture in England, and the interior is
perfectly consonant with the simple grandeur of
the outside. The oak galleries suit the building
admirably. At the east end, near the door,
are the statues of the Duke of Somerset,
Chancellor at the Revolution, and of William
Pitt: the first by Rysbrack, the second by
Nollekens.</p>

<p>After the Senate House, geographically and
in point of time, comes the Pitt Press in
Trumpington Street, a very glorious achievement
of the early Gothic revivalists. Mr
Bowes’ list, published a year or two ago, is
the monumental record of Cambridge printing,
but, when the Pitt Press was founded, the
traditions of John Siborch, who had set up
a press in the University about 1521, had
been almost forgotten. Even since then, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Pitt Press, although the parent of Professor
Jebb’s edition of Sophocles and other masterpieces
of erudition, has scarcely proved itself
the rival of the Clarendon. Its origin is
curious. After the Great Commoner’s death,
a subscription fund was started to commemorate
him, the immediate results of which were the
statues in Westminster Abbey and Hanover
Square. The rest of the money was employed
in building the Pitt Press. In the chronological
order of works of the date, it stands just after
Wilkins’ screen at King’s, and just before Rickman’s
court at St John’s. Its architect was
Edward Blore, and it was finished in 1833. It
is not uglier than most buildings of the period,
and the gateway tower looks well at a sufficient
distance. This tower, by the way, has often
given rise to the impression that it is an
ecclesiastical building of some kind, and it is
known generally as the “freshman’s church.”
The hoax used at one time to be practised
on unsuspecting young gentlemen during their
early days of residence, but the epithet is now
too well known to be misleading.</p>

<p>Further on, and on the same side of Trumpington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Street, is the Fitzwilliam Museum. In
1816 died Richard, Viscount Fitzwilliam, who
bequeathed his library and pictures to the University.
He left also £100,000 for the
building of a museum to receive them. His
princely benefaction was, of course, accepted;
and, pending the erection of a building, the
collections were deposited in the old Perse
School, now the Engineering Laboratory.
Building was not begun till late in the thirties,
when Basevi was employed to execute the
present design. Basevi, however, fell from the
great tower of Ely before the work was finished,
and what he had begun was continued by Mr
Cockerell. This architect had earned a dubiously
just reputation for his proceedings at the
University Library; here he had an excellent
plan to work on, and did justice to it. The
Fitzwilliam Museum, with the exception of
certain decorations, was completed in 1847; the
collections, augmented meanwhile by private
bequests, were brought from the Perse School
in 1848. Differences of opinion exist as to
the merit of the building and the collections,
but there can be no doubt that the façade is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
after that of St Paul’s, one of the best of its
kind anywhere. It is astonishingly good for its
period. The decoration of the entrance hall is
splendid but meretricious, and the lavish profusion
of coloured marbles is almost suspicious.
A statue of the Prince Consort is the cynosure of
this brilliancy, and there is a portrait of him in the
basement, dressed in his Chancellor’s robes, with
a red curtain and the great gate of Trinity in
the background. For the most part the basement
is devoted to the University Museum
of Antiquities, the nucleus of which was bequeathed
by Samuel Disney of the Hyde,
Essex. In memory of this gentleman has been
founded the Disney Professorship of Archæology.
On the ground-floor also is the valuable
Fitzwilliam Library, and a very perfect library
of musical works. In one of the rooms part of
the valuable collection of engravings is exhibited.
This comprises specimens of early Flemish and
German artists, Albert Dürer, the Little Masters
of Germany, and most of the best workers in
wood-cut, steel-engraving, and mezzotint. Others
may be found upstairs among the pictures. The
pictures are of various merit, and many are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
copies. The fine Paul Veronese, “Mercury
turning Aglauros into stone,” which faces the
principal door of the west gallery, is undoubtedly
genuine, and there are some good examples of
the Venetian school, especially two small pictures
attributed to Palma the younger. Lovers of
early Italian art will find a small Madonna and
Child by Pinturicchio, while the disciples of the
now unpopular Bolognese school will admire
the picture of St Roch and the Angel, by
Annibale Caracci. The room also contains a
doubtful Rembrandt, two exquisitely finished
little pictures by Gerard Douw, some good
Ruysdaels, a Teniers or two, and a picture
which, legend says, is the earliest Murillo in
existence. There are also portraits by Gainsborough
and Hogarth.</p>

<p>The south room is even more miscellaneous.
It is presided over by a vast copy of a Veronese,
probably by the artist’s brother, opposite which,
on either side of the entrance from the main
gallery, are two portraits of the school of
Holbein, one of a bygone Fitzwilliam. The
other was given by the executors of the late
Dean of Lincoln, and represents a person unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Besides these, there are numerous small
pictures of the late Italian type, and views of
Venice by Canaletto and Zuccarelli. A very
admirable Raeburn will appeal to all lovers of
portrait art, and deserves wider fame. But the
gem of the whole collection, a series of water-colours
by Turner, is in this room. Mr Ruskin
generously presented the University with these,
and they may be reckoned among its most
priceless treasures. In the eastern continuation
of the room is the collection of small pictures
given by Mr Daniel Mesman in 1834. Some
of these, including a small landscape attributed to
Ruysdael and some delicate pictures by Adam
Elzheimer, are of considerable value; but the
rest are somewhat devoid of interest. On the
south wall is a set of small pictures of the
French school, mostly by Boucher, but two are
attributed to Watteau, and two to Greuze.
They are, however, of no great worth. And
the rooms on the opposite side of the building
are very uninteresting. Sir John Millais’ famous
“Bridesmaid” is in the western room of the
two, in company with some English landscapes,
Mr Watts’ portrait of the late Duke of Devonshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and Mr Richmond’s portrait of the present
Bishop of Durham. The eastern room is occupied
by an immense model of the Taj Mehál, and by
some very early Italian pictures, the most prominent
of which is by Cosimo Rosselli, the painter
whose startling use of colour was so acceptable
to Pope Sixtus IV. Under the curatorship of
Professor Colvin and the late Professor Middleton,
the interest of the Museum was much
increased; and the present curator, Dr James,
the well-known theologian and antiquarian, has
followed in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Since the days of Lord Fitzwilliam’s bequest,
the University’s ardour has been turned in the
direction of science. Most of the public buildings
since then, such as the huge laboratories and
Anatomical Museum (a work of Salvin’s) are
devoted to that interest, and the visitor will
find them more utilitarian than anything else.
In speaking of Pembroke, I have already referred
to Mr Scott’s façade to the Chemical
Laboratory. The archæologist, however, will
be greatly relieved to find the beautiful timber
roof of the Perse school still existing where
he least expects it—namely, in the Engineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Laboratory. These buildings, however,
and others, such as the Observatory in the
Madingley Road, and Sir Digby Wyatt’s extraordinary
façade at Addenbrooke’s Hospital,
which, the famous “Cambridge Freshman” was
gravely informed, was the Vice-Chancellor’s
official residence, speak for themselves. Not
the least important feature of modern Cambridge
is the unobtrusive red-brick building in Mill
Lane, occupied by the University Extension
Syndicate. Not remarkable in itself, it is the
visible sign of the aim of the modern University
not to keep its cherished learning to itself, but
to distribute its advantages to others. Whether
or no the idea expressed by a far-sighted don
in the last century, when he said that each
town ought to have its university, will be
realised, is a possibility that rests on the knees
of the gods; but the means are certainly in
use, and the wish is in a fair way of fulfilment.</p>

<h2 id="XXIII">XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHURCHES OF CAMBRIDGE</span></h2>

<div class="architecture">

<p class="dropcap">Although the architectural interest of
Cambridge, so far as churches are concerned,
is centred in the college chapels, there
are nevertheless several churches which are not
devoid of interest, and one or two which are
quite unique. The visitor who takes the trouble
to examine them will be amply repaid, although
his reminiscences of them will, after a cursory
inspection, be rather confused. Starting, then,
from the western door of the University Church,
and proceeding along King’s Parade, he will
find, just opposite King’s gateway, the narrow
passage which leads to St Edward’s Church.
St Edward’s occupies the centre of a flagged
court, and its east end faces Peas Hill, one of
those Cambridge hills whose slope is invisible.
It is a fairly large church with broad aisles and
a short tower at the west end, and is mostly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the Decorated period, from 1340 to 1350; but
it has been from time to time restored, and the
tower suffers from a hideous coating of stucco.
The nave arcade is lofty but rather meagre.
The font is interesting, and was restored by the
Cambridge Camden Society in the first half of
the century. There are also good Decorated
sedilia in the chancel. It was one of the
centres of reforming influence in Cambridge,
and many of the Marian martyrs, including
Latimer, preached in it.</p>

<p>The next turning on the same side of King’s
Parade is Bene’t Street, in which, at the corner
of Free School Lane, is the very interesting
church of St Benedict, long the chapel of Corpus
Christi College. Although the nave and chancel
of this church were thoroughly restored in 1869
and are very normal examples of later Gothic
work, the tower and western arch belong to
a very early period, certainly anterior to the
Norman Conquest. The tower is rather thicker
than most towers of its date, and rises to a very
respectable height, but it has the characteristic
trait of growing thinner as it reaches the top.
The window-openings of the upper storey are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
small and primitive; that in the centre of each
face is double, its two lights being separated
by a small baluster-shaped column, as is the
case at Earl’s Barton in Northamptonshire and
at other places. The tower-arch, inside the
church, is very curious. It is tall and narrow,
and is also thinner as it reaches the top; the
pilasters which support it on either side have
roughly carved capitals. One may safely refer
the whole structure to the reign of Edward the
Confessor, and possibly earlier. There are two
somewhat similar towers at Lincoln, and a
ruder, but later, tower at Oxford. A staircase
still connects the south-west corner of the
chancel with the old court of Corpus.</p>

<p>On the other side of Corpus is the church of
St Botolph, a picturesque building, chiefly of
Perpendicular date, which belonged for three
centuries to the priory at Barnwell. Like most
churches in Cambridge, it counted the undergraduates
of one or two of the medieval colleges among
its congregation, and the advowson now belongs
to Queens’ College. It is a fine, spacious church,
and its plain tower, with the strange crawling beasts
which serve as waterspouts, is one of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
various objects which contribute to the academical
perspective of Trumpington Street. There
is a good modern window by Mr C. E. Kempe
at the east end of the north aisle.</p>

<p>Not very far on, just opposite Pembroke, is
the extremely beautiful church of St Mary—known
as Little St Mary’s to distinguish it
from the University Church. It is the most
venerable object in a very heterogeneous group
of buildings. Dwarfing it on one side is
Burrough’s classical wing at Peterhouse, and,
on the other, is the tower of the new Congregational
Chapel, a creditable imitation of
the Belfry at Tournai. These, however, show
it to advantage, and add to its venerable aspect.
It is a very lovely example of the later Decorated
style, and was built in 1352 on the site of the
old church of St Peter. There is a tradition
that Alan de Walsingham, who designed the
Octagon at Ely, had something to do with it,
and the very elaborate tracery of the east window
is certainly worthy of a master’s hand. It was
for two hundred and eighty years the chapel of
Peterhouse, and, as at St Bene’t’s, the passage
from college to church is still preserved. Its shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
is that of a college chapel; there are no side-aisles;
and, save in the two bays south of the
sanctuary, the church is lighted by a series of very
large windows. There are two good brasses,
one of a doctor of medicine in his robes, the other
of a lady. It was restored by Sir Gilbert Scott,
and, since then, a western choir-vestry has been
added. In 1891, the east window was thoroughly
restored and glass thoroughly worthy of it was
added by the munificence of Mr Hamblin Smith.
This window, a conventional treatment of the
Annunciation, may be regarded as the best of
Mr Kempe’s many excellent windows. The
small west window was also filled by Mr Kempe
in 1894, but in this he has been less successful.
It is to be hoped that the rest of the windows
will be similarly treated.</p>

<p>Little St Mary’s is almost at the extremity
of Cambridge, and is the last church on the
Trumpington Road. On the Hills Road,
which may be reached by turning to the left
just opposite the Leys School, are the not very
beautiful St Paul’s Church, which is a district
church in the large parish of St Andrew the
Less, and the great Roman Catholic church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
This fine modern building, by Messrs Hansom
of Newcastle, was built at the expense of Mrs
Lyne Stevens, and was consecrated in 1890.
The glass, by Powell of Whitefriars, is interesting
but might be better. There is no church
between this and Christ’s College, opposite
which is St Andrew’s the Great, rebuilt in
1843, and remarkable for nothing save a
memorial tablet in the chancel to Captain Cook
the navigator. Holy Trinity, at the next street-corner,
is in the main a Perpendicular church,
but has been much added to in the present
century. Charles Simeon was for sixty years
vicar of this parish, and its traditions have been
constantly kept up by a succession of noted
Evangelical priests.</p>

<p>From Holy Trinity we pass down Sidney
Street and into Bridge Street. Just opposite
St John’s Chapel is the church of the Holy
Sepulchre, generally known as the Round
Church. This is one of the four churches of
the Templars which remain in England, and
is the earliest. The Temple Church in London
was built several years later; St Sepulchre’s at
Northampton is later again; and the round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
church at Little Maplestead in Essex belongs
to quite the last years of the Order. The round
portion of the Cambridge church belongs to
the earliest Norman period, and was begun in
the reign of William Rufus—that is, before
1100. It consists of eight divisions. The
round-headed arches of the ground-floor rest
upon massive round piers; dwarf piers on the
same principle support the arches of the triforium,
which include a double arch separated
by a slender central pillar and springing from
pilasters attached to the main piers. The
clerestory above is lighted by eight round-headed
openings, splayed inwardly. The ribs
of the conical roof continue into the clerestory
and triforium and finish in the spandrils of
the triforium arches with grotesque corbels.
Although all this is on a miniature scale, the
effect is very grand and solemn. The good
taste of the last century blocked up the triforium
and filled the ground-floor with pews. The
exterior had been adorned much earlier with
an upper storey. This, to be in harmony with
the late Perpendicular chancel, was crowned by
an ugly battlement. In 1841, the Cambridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Camden Society took the church in hand. Their
architect was Salvin, who restored it very well,
taking down the upper storey, adding a conical
slate roof in agreement with tradition, and opening
out the Norman doorway. Unfortunately,
the Society’s taste in stained glass was not
very advanced, and the gaudy east window by
Willement is not at all appropriate. Wailes’
glass in the round part is much better, but is
not all that could be desired. The Society’s
stone altar was the subject of a <i lang="fr">cause celèbre</i>, and
was pronounced illegal by Sir Herbert Jenner Fust
in 1845. This unhappy incident was the result
of the dissolution of a society which had done
literally everything for the cause of Cambridge
archæology, and was no small factor in the great
Church revival of the forties. St Sepulchre’s
is one of those rare livings which are in the
gift of the parishioners; and the burgesses of the
parish are very tenacious of their privilege.</p>

<p>Lower down, on the same side of Bridge
Street, a very ignominious spire invites us to St
Clement’s, a church in the gift of Jesus College.
This spire was built from a bequest of Cole, the
well-known antiquary, early in the century, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
above the west door is inscribed the punning
motto, “Deum Cole.” The body of the church
is Early English. St Clement’s is the last church
on the east side of the river. St Giles’, just beyond
Magdalene, is a large modern church with
an unfinished west end, but its history is not uninteresting.
There is no doubt that the priory
church of St Giles stood on this site, under the
shadow of the castle. A Norman arch from
the old church has been incorporated in the
south aisle of the present building; and, across
the street, the interesting little church of St
Peter, whose detail is partially Norman, doubtless
served as an extra chapel. However, as the
importance of the house increased, it removed to
the suburb of Barnwell. We know that the
monastery was founded by Hugolina Picot and
her husband, somewhere about 1090. The
Barnwell removal took place in 1122, under
the auspices of Pain Peverel, standard-bearer to
Robert of Normandy. In Barnwell, the squalid
suburb of Cambridge which lies between the
Newmarket Road and Parker’s Piece, no remains
of the actual priory exist. It stood somewhere
near the ugly modern church, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
although it is the parish church of St Andrew
the Less, is called Christ Church. The little
Early English building further down the Newmarket
Road was, we may presume, a parochial
chapel served by the Benedictines of the priory.
It now bears the proud but doubly erroneous title
of the Abbey Church. And the beautiful Norman
chapel at Stourbridge, close to the modern
Barnwell Junction, stood in a similar relation
to what must have been one of the principal of
the lesser Benedictine houses in England.</p>

<p>However, no one, unless he is a philanthropist
or an impressionist painter, will go out of his way
to visit Barnwell; and very few casual visitors
get as far as St Giles’, unless they lose their
way. The church of St Luke at New Chesterton,
not far beyond, is a good modern building,
and its spire forms a prominent feature in the
view of Cambridge from the Ely Road. Returning
to the Round Church, where the two
main arteries of Cambridge meet, we turn to the
right past St John’s Chapel and the Divinity
Schools.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Between the latter building and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Whewell’s Court of Trinity is a triangular
space which is the site of All Saints’ Church.
All Saints’ formed, rather more than thirty
years ago, a somewhat interesting feature in the
streets of Cambridge, for its tower projected
into the street, and the pavement ran through
an archway beneath it. It was removed when
Whewell’s Court was built, and Mr G. F.
Bodley erected a handsome new church just
opposite Jesus College. All Saints’ is, like St
Clement’s, a Jesus living. This later building
is the best of modern Cambridge churches. Its
spire is very good, and the east window is a
curious experiment by the late Sir Edward
Burne-Jones and Mr William Morris. The
present Dean of Lichfield, who is a Jesus man,
has also enriched the church with a charming
little window by Mr Kempe. However, old All
Saints’ has gone the way of one or two other
Cambridge churches—as, for instance, the older
St Peter’s, which was taken down to make way
for Little St Mary’s, and St John the Baptist’s,
which was near Clare. This open space and
disused churchyard are its only memorial. The
column in the centre was the gift of one Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Boott, an American, who wished to erect some
memorial to Kirke White in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Before we return to Great St Mary’s, we pass
the Decorated church of St Michael, which was
built by Hervé de Staunton in 1337, and served
as a chapel to his foundation of Michael House.
It is a fine church, a good deal modernised, but
containing sedilia in the chancel, which are not
unlike those at St Edward’s. The stalls in the
choir are very complete, and are very excellent
examples of fifteenth-century woodwork. At the
end of the south aisle is a picture of Charles I.
which bears a very close resemblance to the
famous frontispiece of the <cite>Eikon Basilike</cite>. When
Henry VIII. amalgamated the numerous foundations
in this quarter of the town, and founded
Trinity College, this church, like Great St
Mary’s, became college property, and the living
is still in the gift of Trinity. In St Michael’s
was buried Paul Fagius, the Lutheran Hebraist,
who lectured in Cambridge and died there during
the reign of Edward VI. His bones, however,
were exhumed to gratify Queen Mary’s Commissioners
in 1557, and were burned with those
of Bucer in the Market Place. This is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the few historical facts which we can connect
with Cambridge churches. They are, architecturally
speaking, much more interesting than
the churches of many old towns, and people
who are weary of the sameness of the churches
crowded together in places like Norwich or
Colchester will turn to these with relief. But
their records are barren, and, although we know a
certain amount about Barnwell Priory, we should
like to know more. While of the Templars’
church absolutely no record remains, and the
building merely informs us with a baffling reticence
that Cambridge must at one time, among its
religious houses, have numbered a rich and important
Commandery of that glorious but unfortunate
Order.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
